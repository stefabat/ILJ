abstract = {The interaction of molecular hydrogen with carbon nanostructures is investigated within the DFT/CC correction scheme. The DFT/CC results are compared with the benchmark calculations at the CCSD(T) level of theory for benzene and naphthalene, and at the MP2 level for the more extended systems. The DFT/CC method offers a reliable alternative to the highly correlated ab initio calculations at a cost comparable to the standard DFT method. The results for H(2) adsorbed on graphene as well as single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) are presented. The DFT/CC binding energy on graphene of 5.4 kJ mol(-1) is in good agreement with experiment (5.00+/-0.05 kJ mol(-1)). For (10,10)-SWCNT, the H(2) molecule is mostly stabilized inside the tube with an estimated binding energy of 7.2 kJ mol(-1).},

abstract = {Divide-Expand-Consolidate (DEC) is a local correlation method where the inherent locality of the electron correlation problem is used to express the correlated calculation on a large molecular system in terms of small independent fragment calculations employing small subsets of local HF orbitals. A crucial feature of the DEC scheme is that the sizes of the local orbital spaces are determined in a black box manner during the calculation. In this way it is ensured that the correlation energy has been determined to a predefined precision compared to a conventional calculation. In the present work we apply the DEC scheme to calculate the correlation energy as well as the electron density matrix for the insulin molecule using second order M{\o}ller-Plesset (MP2) theory. This is the first DEC calculation on a molecular system which is too large to be treated using a conventional MP2 implementation. The fragmentation errors for the insulin DEC calculation are carefully analyzed using internal consistency checks. It is demonstrated that size-intensive properties are determined to the same precision for small and large molecules. For example, the percentage of correlation energy recovered and the error per electron in the correlated density matrix depend only on the predefined precision and not on the molecular size.},

abstract = {This article reviews the electronic and transport properties of carbon nanotubes. The focus is mainly theoretical, but when appropriate the relation with experimental results is mentioned. While simple band-folding arguments will be invoked to rationalize how the metallic or semiconducting character of nanotubes is inferred from their topological structure, more sophisticated tight-binding and  ab initio  treatments will be introduced to discuss more subtle physical effects, such as those induced by curvature, tube-tube interactions, or topological defects. The same approach will be followed for transport properties. The fundamental aspects of conduction regimes and transport length scales will be presented using simple models of disorder, with the derivation of a few analytic results concerning specific situations of short- and long-range static perturbations. Further, the latest developments in semiempirical or  ab initio  simulations aimed at exploring the effect of realistic static scatterers (chemical impurities, adsorbed molecules, etc.) or inelastic electron-phonon interactions will be emphasized. Finally, specific issues, going beyond the noninteracting electron model, will be addressed, including excitonic effects in optical experiments, the Coulomb-blockade regime, and the Luttinger liquid, charge density waves, or superconducting transition.},

In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {Tensor network states are used to approximate ground states of local Hamiltonians on a lattice in D spatial dimensions. Different types of tensor network states can be seen to generate different geometries. Matrix product states (MPS) in D=1 dimensions, as well as projected entangled pair states (PEPS) in D>1 dimensions, reproduce the D-dimensional physical geometry of the lattice model; in contrast, the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) generates a (D+1)-dimensional holographic geometry. Here we focus on homogeneous tensor networks, where all the tensors in the network are copies of the same tensor, and argue that certain structural properties of the resulting many-body states are preconditioned by the geometry of the tensor network and are therefore largely independent of the choice of variational parameters. Indeed, the asymptotic decay of correlations in homogeneous MPS and MERA for D=1 systems is seen to be determined by the structure of geodesics in the physical and holographic geometries, respectively; whereas the asymptotic scaling of entanglement entropy is seen to always obey a simple boundary law -- that is, again in the relevant geometry. This geometrical interpretation offers a simple and unifying framework to understand the structural properties of, and helps clarify the relation between, different tensor network states. In addition, it has recently motivated the branching MERA, a generalization of the MERA capable of reproducing violations of the entropic boundary law in D>1 dimensions.},

The methods are presented and demonstrated using S = 1/2 and S = 1 Heisenberg chains as test cases. The key idea of the formulation is that rather than keep the lowest-lying eigenstates of the Hamiltonian in forming a new effective Hamiltonian of a block of sites, one should keep the most significant eigenstates of the block density matrix, obtained from diagonalizing the Hamiltonian of a larger section of the lattice which includes the block. This approach is much more accurate than the standard approach; for example, energies for the S = 1 Heisenberg chain can be obtained to an accuracy of at least 10^-9. The method can be applied to almost any one-dimensional quantum lattice system, and can provide a wide variety of static properties.},

abstract = {The behavior of the Position−Spread Tensor ($\Lambda$) in a series of light diatomic molecules (either neutral or negative ions) is investigated at a Full Configuration Interaction level. This tensor, which is the second moment cumulant of the total position operator, is invariant with respect to molecular translations, while its trace is also rotationally invariant. Moreover, the tensor is additive in the case of noninteracting subsystems and can be seen as an intrinsic property of a molecule. In the present work, it is shown that the longitudinal component of the tensor, $\Lambda$∥, which is small for internuclear distances close to the equilibrium, tends to grow if the bond is stretched. A maximum is reached in the region of the bond breaking, then $\Lambda$∥ decreases and converges toward the isolated-atom value. The degenerate transversal components, $\Lambda$⊥, on the other hand, usually have a monotonic growth toward the atomic value. The Position Spread is extremely sensitive to reorganization of the molecular wave function, and it becomes larger in the case of an increase of the electron mobility, as illustrated by the neutral-ionic avoided crossing in LiF. For these reasons, the Position Spread can be an extremely useful property that characterizes the nature of the wave function in a molecular system. 1.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes can be thought of as graphitic sheets with a hexagonal lattice that have been wrapped up into a seamless cylinder. Since their discovery in 19911, the peculiar electronic properties of these structures have attracted much attention. Their electronic conductivity, for example, has been predicted2, 3, 4 to depend sensitively on tube diameter and wrapping angle (a measure of the helicity of the tube lattice), with only slight differences in these parameters causing a shift from a metallic to a semiconducting state. In other words, similarly shaped molecules consisting of only one element (carbon) may have very different electronic behaviour. Although the electronic properties of multi-walled and single-walled nanotubes5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 have been probed experimentally, it has not yet been possible to relate these observations to the corresponding structure. Here we present the results of scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy on individual single-walled nanotubes from which atomically resolved images allow us to examine electronic properties as afunction of tube diameter and wrapping angle. We observe bothmetallic and semiconducting carbon nanotubes and find thatthe electronic properties indeed depend sensitively on thewrapping angle. The bandgaps of both tube types are consistent with theoretical predictions. We also observe van Hove singularities at the onset of one-dimensional energy bands, confirming the strongly one-dimensional nature of conduction within nanotubes.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTVariational two-electron reduced-density-matrix (2-RDM) methods can provide a reference-independent description of the electronic structure of strongly correlated molecules and materials. These methods represent one of few ways of performing large active-space-based computations that are beyond the scope of conventional configuration-interaction-based approaches. However, implementations of the method are quite rare, making it difficult for the quantum chemistry community to assess the utility of the approach. Here, we discuss an open-shell implementation of the variational 2-RDM method and explore its ability to describe different spin states in several model systems, including linear hydrogen chains and linear acenes. The largest calculations considered are comparable to complete-active-space computations with 50 electrons in 50 orbitals.},

Correlation-consistent polarized valence and core-valence basis sets up to sextuple zeta quality are employed. Guided by basis-set limits established by rij-dependent methods, a number of extrapolation schemes for use with the correlation-consistent basis sets are investigated. Among the schemes considered here, a linear least-squares procedure applied to the quintuple and sextuple zeta results yields the most accurate extrapolations.},

abstract = {The development of new technological materials has historically been a difficult and time-consuming task. The traditional role of computation in materials design has been to better understand existing materials. However, an emerging paradigm for accelerated materials discovery is to design new compounds in silico using firstprinciples calculations, and then perform experiments on the computationally designed candidates. In this paper, we provide a review of ab initio computational materials design, focusing on instances in which a computational approach has been successfully applied to propose new materials of technological interest in the laboratory. Our examples include applications in renewable energy, electronic, magnetic and multiferroic materials, and catalysis, demonstrating that computationally guided materials design is a broadly applicable technique. We then discuss some of the common features and limitations of successful theoretical predictions across fields, examining the different ways in which first-principles calculations can guide the final experimental result. Finally, we present a future outlook in which we expect that new models of computational search, such as high-throughput studies, will play a greater role in guiding materials advancements.},

A review of the NEVPT approach is presented, starting from the original second order state-specific formulation, going through the quasidegenerate multi-state extension and arriving at the recent implementations of the third order in the energy and of the internally contracted configuration interaction. The chief properties of NEVPT-size consistence and absence of intruder states-are analyzed.

The authors show that this long-range correction works particularly well in combination with the short-range variant of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange functional. This long-range-corrected hybrid, here denoted LC-omegaPBE, is remarkably accurate for a broad range of molecular properties, such as thermochemistry, barrier heights of chemical reactions, bond lengths, and most notably, description of processes involving long-range charge transfer.},

abstract = {The particle-particle random phase approximation (pp-RPA) for calculating excitation energies has been applied to diradical systems. With pp-RPA, the two nonbonding electrons are treated in a subspace configuration interaction fashion while the remaining part is described by density functional theory (DFT). The vertical or adiabatic singlet-triplet energy gaps for a variety of categories of diradicals, including diatomic diradicals, carbene-like diradicals, disjoint diradicals, four-$\pi$-electron diradicals, and benzynes are calculated. Except for some excitations in four-$\pi$-electron diradicals, where four-electron correlation may play an important role, the singlet-triplet gaps are generally well predicted by pp-RPA. With a relatively low O(r(4)) scaling, the pp-RPA with DFT references outperforms spin-flip configuration interaction singles. It is similar to or better than the (variational) fractional-spin method. For small diradicals such as diatomic and carbene-like ones, the error of pp-RPA is slightly larger than noncollinear spin-flip time-dependent density functional theory (NC-SF-TDDFT) with LDA or PBE functional. However, for disjoint diradicals and benzynes, the pp-RPA performs much better and is comparable to NC-SF-TDDFT with long-range corrected $\omega$PBEh functional and spin-flip configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles (SF-CIS(D)). In particular, with a correct asymptotic behavior and being almost free from static correlation error, the pp-RPA with DFT references can well describe the challenging ground state and charge transfer excitations of disjoint diradicals in which almost all other DFT-based methods fail. Therefore, the pp-RPA could be a promising theoretical method for general diradical problems.},

abstract = {In multiconfigurational perturbation theory, so-called intruders may cause singularities in the potential energy functions, at geometries where an energy denominator becomes zero. When the singularities are weak, they may be successfully removed by level shift techniques. When applied to excited states, a small shift merely moves the singularity. A large shift may cause new divergencies, and too large shifts are unacceptable since the potential function is affected in regions further away from the singularities. This Letter presents an alternative which may be regarded as an imaginary shift. The singularities are not moved, but disappear completely. They are replaced by a small distortion of the potential function. Applications to the N2 ground state, its A3Sigmau+ state, and the Cr2 ground state show that the distortion caused by this procedure is small.},

abstract = {A new lanthanide chelating tag (M8) for paramagnetic labeling of biomolecules is presented, which is based on an eight-fold, stereoselectively methyl-substituted DOTA that can be covalently linked to the host molecule by a single disulfide bond. The steric overcrowding of the DOTA scaffold leads to an extremely rigid, kinetically and chemically inert lanthanide chelator. Its steric bulk restricts the motion of the tag relative to the host molecule. These properties result in very large pseudocontact shifts (>5 ppm) and residual dipolar couplings (>20 Hz) for Dy-M8 linked to ubiquitin, which are unprecedented for a small, single-point-attachment tag. Such large pseudocontact shifts should be well detectable even for larger proteins and distances beyond approximately 50 A. Due to its exceptionally high stability and lanthanide affinity M8 can be used under extreme chemical or physical conditions, such as those applied for protein denaturation, or when it is undesirable that buffer or protein react with excess lanthanide ions.},

Hydrogen atoms have been stored electrochemically in CNTs. We find that hydrogens exist as a form of H2 molecule in an empty space inside CNTs, which was confirmed by Raman spectra. Several adsorption sites in/on CNTs are observed during the discharging process. We perform density-functional-based tight-binding calculations to search for adsorption sites and predict maximum hydrogen storage capacity. Our calculations show that the storage capacity of hydrogen, limited by the repulsive forces between H2 molecules inside nanotubes, increases linearly with tube diameters in single-walled nanotubes, whereas this value is independent of tube diameters in multi-walled nanotubes. We predict that H storage capacity in (10,10) nanotubes can exceed 14 wt.% (160 kg H2/m3).},

abstract = {The interactions within two models for graphene, coronene and hexabenzocoronene (HBC), and (H 3C(CH 2) 5) 6-HBC, a synthesizable model for asphaltenes, were studied using density functional theory (DFT) with dispersion corrections. The corrections were implemented using carbon atom-centered effective core-type potentials that were designed to correct the erroneous long-range behavior of several DFT methods. The potentials can be used with any computational chemistry program package that can handle standard effective core potential input, without the need for software modification. Testing on a set of common noncovalently bonded dimers shows that the potentials improve calculated binding energies by factors of 2-3 over those obtained without the potentials. Binding energies are predicted to within ca. 15%, and monomer separations to within ca. 0.1 A, of high-level wave function data. The application of the present approach predicts binding energies and structures of the coronene dimer that are in excellent agreement with the results of other DFT methods in which dispersion is taken into account. Dimers of HBC show extensive binding in pi-stacking arrangements, with the largest binding energy, 44.8 kcal/mol, obtained for a parallel-displaced structure. This structure is inline with the published crystal structure. Conformations in which the monomers are perpendicular to one another are much more weakly bound and have binding energies less than 10 kcal/mol. For dimers of (H 3C(CH 2) 5) 6-HBC, which contain 336 atoms, we find that a slipped-parallel structure with C s symmetry has a binding energy of 52.4 kcal/mol, 8.9 kcal/mol lower than that of a bowl-like, C 6 v -symmetric structure.},

abstract = {A density matrix formulation of the super-CI MCSCF method is presented. The MC expansion is assumed to be complete in an active subset of the orbital space, and the corresponding CI secular problem is solved by a direct scheme using the unitary group approach. With a density matrix formulation the orbital optimization step becomes independent of the size of the CI expansion. It is possible to formulate the super-CI in terms of density matrices defined only in the small active subspace; the doubly occupied orbitals (the inactive subspace) do not enter. Further, in the unitary group formalism it is straightforward and simple to obtain the necessary density matrices from the symbolic formula list. It then becomes possible to treat very long MC expansions, the largest so far comprising 726 configurations. The method is demonstrated in a calculation of the potential curves for the three lowest states (1$\Sigma$+g, 3$\Sigma$+u and 3$\Pi$g) of the N2 molecule, using a medium-sized gaussian basis set. Seven active orbitals were used yielding the following results: De: 8.76 (9.90), 2.43 (3.68) and 3.39 (4.90) eV; re: 1.108 (1.098), 1.309 (1.287) and 1.230 (1.213) {\AA}; $\omega$e: 2333 (2359), 1385 (1461) and 1680 (1733) cm−1, for the three states (experimental values within parentheses). The results of these calculations indicate that it is important to consider not only the dissociation limit but also the united atom limit in partitioning the occupied orbital space into an active and an inactive part.},

abstract = {We extend the spin-adapted density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm of McCulloch and Gulacsi [Europhys. Lett. 57, 852 (2002)] to quantum chemical Hamiltonians. This involves using a quasi-density matrix, to ensure that the renormalized DMRG states are eigenfunctions of Ŝ(2), and the Wigner-Eckart theorem, to reduce overall storage and computational costs. We argue that the spin-adapted DMRG algorithm is most advantageous for low spin states. Consequently, we also implement a singlet-embedding strategy due to Tatsuaki [Phys. Rev. E 61, 3199 (2000)] where we target high spin states as a component of a larger fictitious singlet system. Finally, we present an efficient algorithm to calculate one- and two-body reduced density matrices from the spin-adapted wavefunctions. We evaluate our developments with benchmark calculations on transition metal system active space models. These include the Fe(2)S(2), [Fe(2)S(2)(SCH(3))(4)](2-), and Cr(2) systems. In the case of Fe(2)S(2), the spin-ladder spacing is on the microHartree scale, and here we show that we can target such very closely spaced states. In [Fe(2)S(2)(SCH(3))(4)](2-), we calculate particle and spin correlation functions, to examine the role of sulfur bridging orbitals in the electronic structure. In Cr(2) we demonstrate that spin-adaptation with the Wigner-Eckart theorem and using singlet embedding can yield up to an order of magnitude increase in computational efficiency. Overall, these calculations demonstrate the potential of using spin-adaptation to extend the range of DMRG calculations in complex transition metal problems.},

abstract = {A new allotrope of nitrogen in which the atoms are connected to form a novel N6 molecule is predicted to exist at ambient conditions. The N6 molecule is a charge-transfer complex with an open-chain structure containing both single and triple bonds. The charge transfer induces ionic characteristics in the intermolecular interactions and leads to a much higher cohesive energy for the predicted crystal compared to solid N2. The N6 solid is also more stable than a previously reported polymeric solid of nitrogen. Because of the kinetic stability of the molecules and strong intermolecular interactions, the N6 crystal is shown by metadynamics simulations to be dynamically stable around room temperature and to only dissociate to N2 molecules above 700 K. The N6 crystal can likely be synthesized under high-pressure high-temperature conditions, and the considerable metastability may allow for an ambient-pressure recovery of the crystal. Because of the large energy difference between the single and triple bonds, the dissociation of the N6 crystal is expected to release a large amount of energy, placing it among the most efficient energy materials known today.},

These large (supra)molecular systems are typically studied using conventional DFT methods, which do not describe well the van der Waals interactions responsible for this process. Here we use CCSD(T)-calibrated MP2 calculations to estimate binding energies by considering four defective structures (hydrogenated divacancy, octagon-pentagon, and two Stone-Wales defects). The largest physisorption energies for the nondefective CNT are for configurations in which H2 points toward the center of one ring. The computed interaction energies for defect-free CNT are in the range 5.7 to 5.9 kJ/mol, in good agreement with the experimental value of 5.98 kJ/mol. The defects introduced in the (9,0)-CNT increase the surface area of the nanotube, such that the largest surface in found in the 55-77 Stone-Wales defective CNT that furthermore is the most aromatic. Only that defect enlarges the physisorption binding energy, which can become >25% larger. Moreover, a cooperative effect in the adsorption of H2 not appearing in the regular structure is found.},

abstract = {Quantum electrodynamics (resulting from the merger of quantum mechanics and relativity theory) has provided a clear understanding of phenomena ranging from particle physics to cosmology and from astrophysics to quantum chemistry. The ideas underlying quantum electrodynamics also influence the theory of condensed matter, but quantum relativistic effects are usually minute in the known experimental systems that can be described accurately by the non-relativistic Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective 'speed of light' c* approximately 10(6) m s(-1). Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass m(c) of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = m(c)c*2. This two-dimensional system is not only interesting in itself but also allows access to the subtle and rich physics of quantum electrodynamics in a bench-top experiment.},

This ansatz strongly reduces the length of the configuration expansion as compared to uncontracted wave functions, but avoids bottlenecks occurring when fully contracted first-order wave functions are used. The method, which also allows the use of state-averaged MCSCF reference functions, is applied to optimize the structures of low-lying valence and Rydberg states of Pyrrole. Nonplanar equilibrium structures and large geometry relaxation effects on the excitation energies are found for the valence states.

This Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (HCI) algorithm makes use of two parameters that control the tradeoff between speed and accuracy, one which controls the selection of determinants to add to a variational wavefunction, and one which controls the the selection of determinants used to compute the perturbative correction to the variational energy. We show that HCI provides an accurate treatment of both static and dynamic correlation by computing the potential energy curve of the multireference carbon dimer in the cc-pVDZ basis. We then demonstrate the speed and accuracy of HCI by recovering the full configuration interaction energy of both the carbon dimer in the cc-pVTZ basis and the strongly-correlated chromium dimer in the Ahlrichs VDZ basis, correlating all electrons, to an accuracy of better than 1 mHa, in just a few minutes on a single core.

abstract = {The similarities between Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) are explored. Both methods can be formulated as the variational optimization of a wave-function Ansatz. Linearization of the time-dependent variational principle near a variational minimum allows to derive the random phase approximation (RPA). We show that the nonredundant parameterization of the matrix product state (MPS) tangent space [ J. Haegeman, J. I. Cirac, T. J. Osborne, I. Pi{\v{z}}orn, H. Verschelde and F. Verstraete Phys. Rev. Lett. 107 070601 (2011)] leads to the Thouless theorem for MPS, i.e., an explicit nonredundant parameterization of the entire MPS manifold, starting from a specific MPS reference. Excitation operators are identified, which extends the analogy between HF and DMRG to the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA), the configuration interaction (CI) expansion, and coupled cluster theory. For a small one-dimensional Hubbard chain, we use a CI-MPS Ansatz with single and double excitations to improve on the ground state and to calculate low-lying excitation energies. For a symmetry-broken ground state of this model, we show that RPA-MPS allows to retrieve the Goldstone mode. We also discuss calculations of the RPA-MPS correlation energy. With the long-range quantum chemical Pariser-Parr-Pople Hamiltonian, low-lying TDA-MPS and RPA-MPS excitation energies for polyenes are obtained.},

abstract = {The longitudinal polarizabilities of carbon nanotubes are determined using first principles density functional theory. These results demonstrate that the polarizability per atom of a nanotube in the axial direction is primarily determined by the band gap. In fact, polarizability per atom versus inverse band gap yields a linear trend for all nanotubes and methods utilized in this study, creating a universal relationship for longitudinal polarizability. This can be explained by examining the terms in the sum over states equation used to determine polarizability and noting that the vast majority of the polarizability arises from a few elements near the band gap. This universal trend is then used with experimentally determined band gaps to predict the experimental polarizability of carbon nanotubes.},

abstract = {13C NMR chemical shifts of selected finite-size models of pristine zigzag single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with a diameter of ∼0.4–0.8 nm and length up to 2.2 nm were studied theoretically. Results for finite SWCNTs models containing 1, 4 and 10 adjacent bamboo-type units were compared with data obtained for infinite tubes in order to estimate the reliability of small finite models in predicting mag- netic properties of real-size nanotubes and to assess their tube-length dependence. SWCNTs were fully optimized using unrestricted density functional theory (DFT-UB3LYP/6-31G*). Cyclacenes, as the short- est models of open-ended zigzag SWCNTs, with systematically varying diameter were calculated as well. GIAO NMR calculations on the SWCNT and cyclacene models were performed using the BHandH density functional combined with relatively small STO-3Gmag basis set, developed by Leszczy ´nski and coworkers for accurate description of magnetic properties. Regular changes of carbon 13C chemical shifts along the tube axis of real size (6, 0) and (9, 0) zigzag carbon nanotubes were shown. The 13C NMR shifts accord- ing to increasing diameter calculated for zigzag (n, 0, n = 5–10) cyclacenes followed the trends observed for zigzag (n, 0) SWCNTs. The results for 4-units long SWCNTs match reasonably well with the data obtained for infinite zigzag (n, 0) SWCNTs, especially to those with bigger diameter (n = 8-15). The pres- ence of rim hydrogens obviously affects theoretical 13C chemical shieldings and shifts in cyclacenes and thus cyclacenes can provide only approximate estimation of 13C NMR parameters of real-size SWCNTs. The NMR properties predicted for the longest 10-units long models of SWCNTs reliably correspond to results obtained for infinite nanotubes. They were thus able to accurately predict also recently reported experimental chemical shift of chiral (6, 5) SWCNT.},

In both cases, description of the chemical bond are chosen that are appropriate for the particular research or application. Therefore, there are significant differences in the understanding as what constitutes chemical bonding. This is acceptable in practice but proves to be a hindrance for true interdisciplinarity. The concept of the chemical bond offer a firm basis upon which to forge links not only within chemistry but also to all related sciences. The general desire and the growing necessity for interdisciplinary collaboration requires a careful treatment of these concepts and, if possible, a tightening and standardization to a level that is widely acceptable and beneficial. In the age of tremendously fast development of computers and computer science, we believe that the electron localization function (ELF) provides a new description of the chemical bond for almost all classes of compounds. Its graphical language earns it the ultimate qualification for enhanced interdisciplinarity.},

@article{Zuttel2004,
abstract = {Hydrogen exhibits the highest heating value per mass of all chemical fuels. Furthermore, hydrogen is regenerative and environmentally friendly. There are two reasons why hydrogen is not the major fuel of today's energy consumption. First of all, hydrogen is just an energy carrier. And, although it is the most abundant element in the universe, it has to be produced, since on earth it only occurs in the form of water and hydrocarbons. This implies that we have to pay for the energy, which results in a difficult economic dilemma because ever since the industrial revolution we have become used to consuming energy for free. The second difficulty with hydrogen as an energy carrier is its low critical temperature of 33 K (i.e. hydrogen is a gas at ambient temperature). For mobile and in many cases also for stationary applications the volumetric and gravimetric density of hydrogen in a storage material is crucial. Hydrogen can be stored using six different methods and phenomena: (1) high-pressure gas cylinders (up to 800 bar), (2) liquid hydrogen in cryogenic tanks (at 21 K), (3) adsorbed hydrogen on materials with a large specific surface area (at T<100 K), (4) absorbed on interstitial sites in a host metal (at ambient pressure and temperature), (5) chemically bonded in covalent and ionic compounds (at ambient pressure), or (6) through oxidation of reactive metals, e.g. Li, Na, Mg, Al, Zn with water. The most common storage systems are high-pressure gas cylinders with a maximum pressure of 20 MPa (200 bar). New lightweight composite cylinders have been developed which are able to withstand pressures up to 80 MPa (800 bar) and therefore the hydrogen gas can reach a volumetric density of 36 kg.m(-3), approximately half as much as in its liquid state. Liquid hydrogen is stored in cryogenic tanks at 21.2 K and ambient pressure. Due to the low critical temperature of hydrogen (33 K), liquid hydrogen can only be stored in open systems. The volumetric density of liquid hydrogen is 70.8 kg.m(-3), and large volumes, where the thermal losses are small, can cause hydrogen to reach a system mass ratio close to one. The highest volumetric densities of hydrogen are found in metal hydrides. Many metals and alloys are capable of reversibly absorbing large amounts of hydrogen. Charging can be done using molecular hydrogen gas or hydrogen atoms from an electrolyte. The group one, two and three light metals (e.g. Li, Mg, B, Al) can combine with hydrogen to form a large variety of metal-hydrogen complexes. These are especially interesting because of their light weight and because of the number of hydrogen atoms per metal atom, which is two in many cases. Hydrogen can also be stored indirectly in reactive metals such as Li, Na, Al or Zn. These metals easily react with water to the corresponding hydroxide and liberate the hydrogen from the water. Since water is the product of the combustion of hydrogen with either oxygen or air, it can be recycled in a closed loop and react with the metal. Finally, the metal hydroxides can be thermally reduced to metals in a solar furnace. This paper reviews the various storage methods for hydrogen and highlights their potential for improvement and their physical limitations.},

These calculations use Gaussian orbitals and periodic boundary conditions. We compare results from the local spin density approximation, generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and hybrid density functionals. We have first kept the SWNT geometric structure fixed while a single H atom approaches the tube on top of a carbon atom. In that case, a weakly bound state with binding energies from -0.8 to -0.4 eV was found. Full geometry relaxation leads to a strong SWNT deformation, weakening the nearest C-C bonds and increasing the binding energy by about 1 eV. Full hydrogen coverage of the (5,5) SWNT converts this metallic nanotube into an insulator with a band gap of 3.4 eV for the GGA functional and 4.8 eV for the hybrid functional. Hybrid functionals perform similar to pure density functional theory functionals for the calculation of binding energies while band gaps critically depend on the functional choice.},

abstract = {A quadratically convergent MCSCF method is described which allows one to optimize an energy average of several states with arbitrary weight factors. An analysis of the problems connected with the variational determination of excited states is given and it is concluded that the averaging method is a natural solution to these problems. In the energy expansion minimized in each iteration, certain cubic and higher order terms can be included. It is demonstrated that this greatly facilitates convergence in cases where the Hessian matrix of second energy derivatives has many negative eigenvalues. Several approximations to the exact quadratically convergent scheme, which are useful when calculating potential surfaces, are discussed. I.},

abstract = {We have devised a local ab initio density matrix renormalization group algorithm to describe multireference correlations in large systems. For long molecules that are extended in one of their spatial dimensions, we can obtain an exact characterization of correlation, in the given basis, with a cost that scales only quadratically with the size of the system. The reduced scaling is achieved solely through integral screening and without the construction of correlation domains. We demonstrate the scaling, convergence, and robustness of the algorithm in polyenes and hydrogen chains. We converge to exact correlation energies (in the sense of full configuration interaction, with 1-10 microE(h) precision) in all cases and correlate up to 100 electrons in 100 active orbitals. We further use our algorithm to obtain exact energies for the metal-insulator transition in hydrogen chains and compare and contrast our results with those from conventional quantum chemical methods.},

abstract = {Polymeric nitrogen, as a potential high-energy density material (HEDM), has promising applications for energy storage, propellants, and explosives.The search for an effective method to recover polymeric nitrogen to ambient conditions is of great interest. Here, we study the confinement of polymeric nitrogen chain in boron nitride nanotube (BNNT) with different diameters, and find the polymeric nitrogen chain can be stable in BNNT (5, 5) at ambient conditions, while it can be also stabilized in other diameters of BNNTs with the application of little pressure. The polymeric nitrogen chains encapsulated in the BNNT dissociate into N-2 molecules and release tremendous energy at above 1400 K. The hybrid structure is favored by a charge transfer from BNNT to N chain. The hybrid material has a smaller charge transfer between the N chains and the hosting BNNT compared with other hosting materials. More importantly, this smaller charge transfer not only stabilizes the polymeric nitrogen chain at ambient conditions but also favors the energy release at a more gentle condition, which can be taken as an obvious advantage of BNNT when used as hosting material. Our findings offer a highly promising route for harvesting nitrogen-based HEDMs under ambient or near ambient conditions.},

@article{Moritz2006,
abstract = {The application of the quantum-chemical density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm is cumbersome for complex electronic structures with many active orbitals. The high computational cost is mainly due to the poor convergence of standard DMRG calculations. A factor which affects the convergence behavior of the calculations is the choice of the start-up procedure. In this start-up step matrix representations of operators have to be calculated in a guessed many-electron basis of the DMRG environment block. Different possibilities for the construction of these basis states exist, and we first compare four procedures to approximate the environment states using Slater determinants explicitly. These start-up procedures are applied to DMRG calculations on a sophisticated test system: the chromium dimer. It is found that the converged energies and the rate of convergence depend significantly on the choice of the start-up procedure. However, since already the most simple start-up procedure, which uses only the Hartree-Fock determinant, is comparatively good, Slater determinants, in general, appear not to be a good choice as approximate environment basis states for convergence acceleration. Based on extensive test calculations it is demonstrated that the computational cost can be significantly reduced if the number of total states m is successively increased. This is done in such a way that the environment states are built up stepwise from system states of previous truncated DMRG sweeps for slowly increasing m values.},

abstract = {Planar N(x) systems such as cyclo-N(5)(-) and N(5)(+) tend to be more stable than nonplanar systems such as the neutral cyclo-N(6). It is proposed that the key to stabilization is the separation of the sigma and pi electron systems. In both cyclo-N(5)(-) and N(5)(+), a six-pi-electron system is created upon either adding to or removing from the cyclo-N(5) radical one electron. Judicious addition of oxygen atoms to polynitrogen ring compounds such as cyclo-N(4) and cyclo-N(6) can increase their thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities, accompanied by only a small reduction in their efficiency as high energy density materials (HEDMs). The properties of some of these compounds are calculated and compared with the parent all-nitrogen compounds. Coordination of one or more oxygen atoms to the ring leads to effective separation of the sigma and pi electron systems helping to stabilize the systems. Natural bond analysis indicates that the exocyclic NO bonds can assume a single or double bond character, depending on the ring system.},

On the basis of scanning tunneling microscopy techniques, we report on site-selective adsorption of atomic hydrogen on convexly curved regions of monolayer graphene grown on SiC(0001). This system exhibits an intrinsic curvature owing to the interaction with the substrate. We show that at low coverage hydrogen is found on convex areas of the graphene lattice. No hydrogen is detected on concave regions. These findings are in agreement with theoretical models which suggest that both binding energy and adsorption barrier can be tuned by controlling the local curvature of the graphene lattice. This curvature dependence combined with the known graphene flexibility may be exploited for storage and controlled release of hydrogen at room temperature, making it a valuable candidate for the implementation of hydrogen-storage devices.},

It is shown that the effects of density fitting on optimized structures and relative energies are negligible. For cases in which the total cost is dominated by the integral evaluations and transformations, the DF-CASPT2 gradient calculations are found to be faster than the corresponding conventional calculations by typically a factor of three to five using triple-$\zeta$ basis sets, and by about a factor of ten using quadruple-$\zeta$ basis sets.},

One frequently mentioned application is Feynman's original proposal of simulating quantum systems and, in particular, the electronic structure of molecules and materials. In this paper, we analyze the computational requirements for one of the standard algorithms to perform quantum chemistry on a quantum computer. We focus on the quantum resources required to find the ground state of a molecule twice as large as what current classical computers can solve exactly. We find that while such a problem requires about a 10-fold increase in the number of qubits over current technology, the required increase in the number of gates that can be coherently executed is many orders of magnitude larger. This suggests that for quantum computation to become useful for quantum chemistry problems, drastic algorithmic improvements will be needed.},

We report here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects i f the exponents of the functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although the primitive (s p) functions for describing correlation effects can be taken from atomic Hartree–Fock calculations i f the appropriate primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen‐containing molecules indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation effects as well as the ANO sets of Alml{\"{o}}f and Taylor. Guided by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups. This leads to the concept of c o r r e l a t i o n c o n s i s t e n t b a s i s s e t s, i.e., sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99% of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding ANO sets, even though the latter contains 50% more primitive functions and twice as many primitive polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94%–97% of the total (HF+1+2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron.},

In the case of density functional theory, a broken symmetry approach must be employed and the sensitivity of the results to choice of functional and broken-symmetry protocol is explored. Viewing the [n]-cyclacenes as monomeric building blocks which may be joined to grow finite length (n,0) single-walled carbon nanotubes, density functional calculations are further employed to explore changes in electronic structure associated with increasing nanotube length. Spin-state energy gaps are predicted to decrease both with increasing cyclacene size and with increasing nanotube length; [n]-cyclacenes with odd values of n are predicted to develop polyradical character for smaller n than is the case for even values n.},

The XMS-CASPT2 method is based on the extended multi-configuration quasi-degenerate perturbation theory proposed earlier by Granovsky [J. Chem. Phys., 2011, 134, 214113]. We show that the conical intersection at the XMS-CASPT2 level can be described without artifacts if the entire method is invariant with respect to any unitary rotations of the reference functions. The photoabsorption spectra of the 1(1)B(3u) and 1(1)B(2u) states of pyrazine are simulated, based on a vibronic-coupling model Hamiltonian. The XMS-CASPT2 spectrum of the 1(1)B(3u) band is found to be comparable to the one computed by a more expensive multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) method, while the XMS-CASPT2 simulation of the 1(1)B(2u) band is slightly inferior to the MRCI one.},

Their appeal stems, firstly, from the unique nature of their conjugation, having p orbitals oriented radially rather than perpendicular to the plane of the macrocycle. Secondly, as aromatic belts are model compounds of carbon nanotubes of different chiralities, a synthetic strategy towards the buildup of structural strain in these compounds could finally open a route towards rational chemical synthesis of carbon nanotubes. The elusiveness of these compounds has stimulated fascinating and ingenious synthetic strategies over the last decades. The various strategies are classified here by their approach to the buildup of structural strain, which is the main obstacle in the preparation of these curved polyarenes.},

abstract = {Hydrogen-based fuel cells are promising solutions for the efficient and clean delivery of electricity. Since hydrogen is an energy carrier, a key step for the development of a reliable hydrogen-based technology requires solving the issue of storage and transport of hydrogen. Several proposals based on the design of advanced materials such as metal hydrides and carbon structures have been made to overcome the limitations of the conventional solution of compressing or liquefying hydrogen in tanks. Nevertheless none of these systems are currently offering the required performances in terms of hydrogen storage capacity and control of adsorption/desorption processes. Therefore the problem of hydrogen storage remains so far unsolved and it continues to represent a significant bottleneck to the advancement and proliferation of fuel cell and hydrogen technologies. Recently, however, several studies on graphene, the one-atom-thick membrane of carbon atoms packed in a honeycomb lattice, have highlighted the potentialities of this material for hydrogen storage and raise new hopes for the development of an efficient solid-state hydrogen storage device. Here we review on-going efforts and studies on functionalized and nanostructured graphene for hydrogen storage and suggest possible developments for efficient storage/release of hydrogen under ambient conditions.},

Tree tensor network states represent one of the simplest generalizations of matrix product states and the density matrix renormalization group. While matrix product states encode a one-dimensional entanglement structure, tree tensor network states encode a tree entanglement structure, allowing for a more flexible description of general molecules. We describe an optimal tree tensor network state algorithm for quantum chemistry. We introduce the concept of half-renormalization which greatly improves the efficiency of the calculations. Using our efficient formulation we demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of tree tensor network states versus matrix product states. We carry out benchmark calculations both on tree systems (hydrogen trees and $\pi$-conjugated dendrimers) as well as non-tree molecules (hydrogen chains, nitrogen dimer, and chromium dimer). In general, tree tensor network states require much fewer renormalized states to achieve the same accuracy as matrix product states. In non-tree molecules, whether this translates into a computational savings is system dependent, due to the higher prefactor and computational scaling associated with tree algorithms. In tree like molecules, tree network states are easily superior to matrix product states. As an illustration, our largest dendrimer calculation with tree tensor network states correlates 110 electrons in 110 active orbitals.},

Nevertheless, even for the longest systems considered  72 nm long  pronounced edge effects appear in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. The weight of these edge states scales inversely with the length of the ribbon, and they are expected to become negligible only at ribbon lengths of the order of micrometers.

abstract = {Efficient storage of hydrogen at room temperature is a bottleneck problem for hydrogen-based energy applications. A simple way of hydrogen storage and release by bending carbon nanotubes (CNTs) at room temperature is demonstrated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A large number of hydrogen molecules can be put in CNTs at low temperatures, and then the hydrogen molecules can be completely encapsulated in the CNTs by bending the CNTs to a critical angle. The critical angle decreases with increasing CNT length, while it increases with increasing hydrogen number and temperature. However, the CNT chirality has a negligible influence on the critical angle and hydrogen storage process. It is demonstrated that the release of the hydrogen molecules also can be controlled accurately at room temperature by changing bending angle. The van der Waals force plays an important role in the hydrogen storage and release process. Compared with the conventional methods for hydrogen storage, the brand-new one occurs at room temperature and the release of the hydrogen molecules can be controlled accurately by changing bending angle. Besides, the special structure of the bent CNTs will also significantly enhance their applications in atomic storage, various chemical and biological sensors and actuators, catalyst and catalyst supports, nanoelectronic devices as well as high-capacity energy storage in solar cells or fuel cells. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A benchmark theoretical study of the electronic ground state and of the vertical and adiabatic singlet-triplet (ST) excitation energies of benzene ( n = 1 ) and n -acenes ( C 4 n + 2 H 2 n + 4 ) ranging from naphthalene ( n = 2 ) to heptacene ( n = 7 ) is presented, on the ground of single- and multireference calculations based on restricted or unrestricted zero-order wave functions. High-level and large scale treatments of electronic correlation in the ground state are found to be necessary for compensating giant but unphysical symmetry-breaking effects in unrestricted single-reference treatments. The composition of multiconfigurational wave functions, the topologies of natural orbitals in symmetry-unrestricted CASSCF calculations, the T1 diagnostics of coupled cluster theory, and further energy-based criteria demonstrate that all investigated systems exhibit a A 1 g singlet closed-shell electronic ground state. Singlet-triplet ( S 0 -T 1 ) energy gaps can therefore be very accurately determined by applying the principles of a focal point analysis onto the results of a series of single-point and symmetry-restricted calculations employing correlation consistent cc-pVXZ basis sets ( X = D , T, Q, 5) and single-reference methods [HF, MP2, MP3, MP4SDQ, CCSD, CCSD(T)] of improving quality. According to our best estimates, which amount to a dual extrapolation of energy differences to the level of coupled cluster theory including single, double, and perturbative estimates of connected triple excitations [CCSD(T)] in the limit of an asymptotically complete basis set ( cc-pV ∞ Z ) , the S 0 -T 1 vertical excitation energies of benzene ( n = 1 ) and n -acenes ( n = 2 – 7 ) amount to 100.79, 76.28, 56.97, 40.69, 31.51, 22.96, and 18.16 kcal/mol, respectively. Values of 87.02, 62.87, 46.22, 32.23, 24.19, 16.79, and 12.56 kcal/mol are correspondingly obtained at the CCSD ( T ) / cc-pV ∞ Z level for the S 0 -T 1 adiabatic excitation energies, upon including B3LYP/cc-PVTZ corrections for zero-point vibrational energies. In line with the absence of Peierls distortions, extrapolations of results indicate a vanishingly small S 0 -T 1 energy gap of 0 to ∼ 4 kcal / mol ( ∼ 0.17 eV ) in the limit of an infinitely large polyacene.},

abstract = {Multi-configurational approaches yield universal wave function parameterizations that can qualitatively well describe electronic structures along reaction pathways. For quantitative results, multi-reference perturbation theory is required to capture dynamic electron correlation from the otherwise neglected virtual orbitals. Still, the overall accuracy suffers from the finite size and choice of the active orbital space and peculiarities of the perturbation theory. Fortunately, the electronic wave functions at equilibrium structures of reactants and products can often be well described by single-reference methods and hence are accessible to accurate coupled cluster calculations. Here, we calculate the heterolytic double dissociation energy of four 3d-metallocenes with the complete active space self-consistent field method and compare to highly accurate coupled cluster data. Our coupled cluster data are well within the experimental error bars. This accuracy can also be approached by complete active space calculations with an orbital selection based on information entropy measures. The entropy based active space selection is discussed in detail. We find a very subtle balance between static and dynamic electron correlation effects that emphasizes the need for algorithmic active space selection and that differs significantly from restricted active space results for identical active spaces reported in the literature.},

abstract = {The theory of effective Hamiltonians is well established. However, limitations appear in its applicability for many problems in molecular physics and quantum chemistry. The standard effective Hamiltonians may become strongly non-Hermitian when there is a large coupling between the model space, in which they are defined, and the outer space Moreover, in the presence of intruder states, discontinuities appear in the matrix elements of these effective Hamiltonians as a function of the internuclear distances. To solve these difficulties, a new class of effective Hamiltonians (called intermediate Hamiltonians) is presented; only one part of their roots are exact eigen-energies of the full Hamiltonian. The theory of these intermediate Hamiltonians is presented by means of a new wave-operator R which is the analogue of the wave-operator Omega in the theory of effective Hamiltonians. Solutions are obtained by a generalised degenerate perturbation theory (GDPT) and by iterative procedures. Two model systems are numerically solved which demonstrate the good convergence properties of GDPT with respect to standard degenerate perturbation theory (DPT). Continuity of the solutions is also checked in the presence of an intruder state.},

abstract = {The interaction of hydrogen with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) was analysed. A SWNT sample was exposed to D2 or H2 at a pressure of 2 MPa for 1 h at 298 or 873 K. The desorption spectra were measured by thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). A main reversible desorption site was observed throughout the range 77 to 320 K. The activation energy of this peak at about 90 K was calculated assuming first-order desorption. This corresponds to physisorption on the surface of the SWNTs (19.2±1.2 kJ/mol). A desorption peak was also found for multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), and also for graphite samples. The hydrogen desorption spectrum showed other small shoulders, but only for the SWNT sample. They are assumed to originate from hydrogen physisorbed at sites on the internal surface of the tubes and on various other forms of carbon in the sample. The nanosized metallic particles (Co:Ni) used for nanotube growth did not play any role in the physisorption of molecular hydrogen on the SWNT sample. Therefore, it is concluded that the desorption of hydrogen from nanotubes is related to the specific surface area of the sample. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The number of nontrivial coefficients of a digital filter designed using the FRM technique is only a very small fraction of that of a minimax optimum design meeting the same set of specifications. A digital filter designed using FRM technique is a network of several subfilters. Several methods have been developed for optimizing the subfilters. The earliest method optimizes the subfilters separately and produces a network of subfilters with excellent finite word-length performance. Subsequent techniques optimize the subfilters jointly and produce filters with significantly smaller numbers of nontrivial coefficients. Unfortunately, these joint optimization techniques, that optimize only the overall frequency response characteristics, may produce filters with undesirable finite word-length properties. The design of FRM-based filters that simultaneously optimizes the frequency response and finite wordlength properties had not been reported in the literatures. In this paper, we develop several new optimization approaches that include the finite word-length properties of the overall filter into the optimization process. These new approaches produce filters with excellent finite word-length performance with almost no degradation in frequency response performance.},

abstract = {A carbon nanotube, if it could be cut sideways at the end like a pipe, would yield beltlike structures. These subunits of carbon nanotubes, in their simplest manifestation as the [6](n)cyclacenes, are composed of conjugated six-membered rings that are annelated, that is, made of a series of consecutively fused ring structures. These seemingly simple "one-benzene-thick" slices are of considerable interest as models-for electronic structure and spectroscopic properties, for example-for carbon nanotubes. In the late 1980s Stoddart and co-workers, soon to be followed by other groups, embarked on the synthesis of [6](n)cyclacenes. The necessary curved shape of the belt was achieved with boat-shaped precursors for Diels-Alder reactions, namely, 7-oxanorbornene derivatives. The preferred endo-addition in Diels-Alder reactions assured an efficient synthesis of beltlike systems containing 12 to 18 six-membered rings. However, the removal of the auxiliary oxygen centers to achieve [6](n)cyclacenes as fully conjugated systems has failed so far: they remain an inaccessible target despite some 25 years of synthetic effort. Concurrently, theoretical studies revealed that [6](n)cyclacenes as linearly annelated systems show small energy gaps between triplet and singlet states; they can thus be expected to be unstable species. Angularly annelated systems, on the other hand, were predicted to have large singlet-triplet splittings. Nakamura and co-workers and our laboratory have found ways around the obstacles to create cyclacenes. Nakamura and co-workers prepared the first angular annelated cyclacene by selective reduction of the north and south poles of C(60). We used a cyclic system that is fully conjugated and also adopts a boat conformation: cyclooctatetraene. By following this principle, we synthesized two types of linearly annelated cyclacenes: metal-stabilized four-membered rings alternating with eight-membered rings ([4.8](n)cyclacenes), and six-membered rings alternating with eight-membered rings ([6.8](n)cyclacenes). These new scaffolds, if extended along the molecular axis, would represent as-yet unknown forms of carbon nanotubes and are thus inviting synthetic targets. Calculations show that the incorporation of heteroatoms (S and NH) into these scaffolds is promising, encouraging the synthetic pursuit of thia- and azacyclacenes.},

abstract = {The properties of all materials arise largely from the quantum mechanics of their constituent electrons under the influence of the electric field of the nuclei. The solution of the underlying many-electron Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation is a 'non-polynomial hard' problem, owing to the complex interplay of kinetic energy, electron-electron repulsion and the Pauli exclusion principle. The dominant computational method for describing such systems has been density functional theory. Quantum-chemical methods--based on an explicit ansatz for the many-electron wavefunctions and, hence, potentially more accurate--have not been fully explored in the solid state owing to their computational complexity, which ranges from strongly exponential to high-order polynomial in system size. Here we report the application of an exact technique, full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo to a variety of real solids, providing reference many-electron energies that are used to rigorously benchmark the standard hierarchy of quantum-chemical techniques, up to the 'gold standard' coupled-cluster ansatz, including single, double and perturbative triple particle-hole excitation operators. We show the errors in cohesive energies predicted by this method to be small, indicating the potential of this computationally polynomial scaling technique to tackle current solid-state problems.},

They are an ideal target for theoretical study, where interactions of interest can be probed directly, free from competing secondary interactions. However, the most popular tools of computational chemistry are not particularly reliable for noncovalent interactions. Here we review recent works in wavefunction-based quantum chemistry techniques aimed at greater accuracy and faster computations for these systems. We describe recent developments in high-accuracy benchmarks, a variety of recent wavefunction methods with promise for noncovalent interactions, various approximations to speed up these methods, and recent advances in wavefunction-based symmetry-adapted perturbation theory, which provides not only interaction energies but also their decomposition into physically meaningful components. Together, these advances are currently extending robust, accurate computations of noncovalent interactions from systems with around one dozen heavy atoms up to systems with several dozens of heavy atoms. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Such auxiliary quantities, which allow the second-order perturbation contribution to the energy to be evaluated very efficiently, can be calculated at the outset provided the unperturbed four-particle spinless density matrix in the active orbital space is available.

The difference between methods diminishes as the basis set becomes larger, and the main variation is due to the contraction coefficients, and not the exponent values.

abstract = {Over the last few years people have been interested in the process of singlet fission, owing to its relevance to solar cell technology. The energetics of singlet fission is intimately related to singlet-triplet (ST) gaps and energies of singlet excited states. However, accurate calculations of ST gaps in polyacenes are complicated due to near degeneracies in the $\pi$ orbitals, and therefore, have been quite challenging. The spin-flip equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (SF-EOM-CC) and its perturbative approximation have been shown to correctly treat situations involving electronic degeneracies and near degeneracies. In this work, we use various spin-flip methods to benchmark the ST gaps of small polyacenes and show that the error in the ST gaps with respect to the experiment is small and does not increase appreciably with the system size. The diradical and polyradical character of the polyacene ground states increase with the system size. However, for the small polyacenes the open-shell character of the ground state is still small enough to be treated using single reference methods.},

Our approach is based on the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm to calculate the spin density matrix elements as a basic quantity for the spatially resolved spin density distribution. The spin density matrix elements are directly determined from the second-quantized elementary operators optimized by the DMRG algorithm. As an analytic convergence criterion for the spin density distribution, we employ our recently developed sampling-reconstruction scheme [J. Chem. Phys.2011, 134, 224101] to build an accurate complete-active-space configuration-interaction (CASCI) wave function from the optimized matrix product states. The spin density matrix elements can then also be determined as an expectation value employing the reconstructed wave function expansion. Furthermore, the explicit reconstruction of a CASCI-type wave function provides insight into chemically interesting features of the molecule under study such as the distribution of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ electrons in terms of Slater determinants, CI coefficients, and natural orbitals. The methodology is applied to an iron nitrosyl complex which we have identified as a challenging system for standard approaches [J. Chem. Theory Comput.2011, 7, 2740].},

abstract = {Using relatively approximated methods, physisorption of molecular hydrogen on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as a mechanism to develop hydrogen storage systems has been only partially investigated in literature. Here, we use ab initio molecular-orbital theory, at benchmark quality level, to provide a more complete description about the mentioned mechanism. Physisorption inside and outside achiral-armchair and zigzag-SWCNTs, in the range of diameters from about 6 A-chiral vectors (5,5) and (8,0)-to more than 30 A-chiral vectors (30,30) and (40,0)-was examined. Perpendicular, longitudinal, and transversal configurations, with the hydrogen molecule centered on an aromatic ring, were taken into account. SWCNTs were modeled as curved coronenelike (C24H12) graphene sheets. Local modeling strategies, using more complete basis sets for the adsorbate and for the nearest atoms to the adsorbate than for the lion's share of the substrate, at the Moller-Plesset second-order correlation level, were selected for numerical treatment. Basis-set superposition errors were corrected by means of the counterpoise method of Bois and Bernardi. It was found that physisorption of molecular hydrogen on SWCNTs would depend mainly on the diameter being virtually independent of the chirality. Lowest physisorption energies, up to 20% less than that on planar graphene, would be reached outside nanotubes in the range of diameters of 6-10 A. For hydrogen storage purposes, highest physisorption energies, up to 40% greater than that on planar graphene, but not more, would be reached inside nanotubes in the relatively narrow range of diameters of 10-20 A. Finally, for diameters from 20 A onwards physisorption of molecular hydrogen on SWCNTs would be in the range of +/-10% of that on planar graphene. To our knowledge, this would be the most complete and realistic theoretical investigation of the target physisorption mechanism to date.},

abstract = {A series of polynitrogen molecules composed by multiple cyclic-N3\nand/or cyclic-N5 are systematically investigated by using DFT and\nMP2 methods. It is found that all energetically favored structures\nappear with a corner to corner connection between two rings for the\ncyclic-N3 and/or the cyclic-N5. Furthermore, straight interaction\nbetween the N3-rings would decrease the stability of cyclic-N3 relative\nto the cyclic-N3 radical and thus not favor the formation of a stable\nstructure containing multiple cyclic-N3, while the interaction between\nthe N5-rings can improve the stability of cyclic-N5 and tend to produce\na stable structure composed by multiple cyclic-N5. For the stable\nstructure consisting of cyclic-N3 and cyclic-N5, the charge is transferred\nfrom cyclic-N3 to cyclic-N5, facilitating the stability of N5, and\nthe attacked site of the structure by the radicals is analyzed by\ncondensed Fukui function. Finally, the stabilities of the structures\nN3(N5)3 and N5(N5)5 are investigated and demonstrated to be attributed\nto the charge transfer and the coordination number of N3-ring and\nN5-ring.},

@article{Keller2015a,
abstract = {The efficient and accurate description of the electronic structure of strongly correlated systems is still a largely unsolved problem. The usual procedures start with a multiconfigurational (usually a Complete Active Space, CAS) wavefunction which accounts for static correlation and add dynamical correlation by perturbation theory,\r\nconfiguration interaction, or coupled cluster expansion. This procedure requires the correct selection of the active space. Intuitive methods are unreliable for complex systems. The inexpensive black-box unrestricted natural orbital (UNO) criterion postulates that the Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) charge natural orbitals with fractional occupancy (e.g., between 0.02 and 1.98) constitute the active space. UNOs generally approximate the CAS orbitals so well that the orbital optimization in CAS Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) may be omitted, resulting in the inexpensive UNO-CAS method. A rigorous testing of the UNO criterion requires comparison with approximate full configuration interaction\r\nwavefunctions. This became feasible with the advent of Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) methods which can approximate highly correlated wavefunctions at affordable cost. We have compared active orbital occupancies in UNO-CAS and CASSCF calculations with DMRG in a number of strongly correlated molecules: compounds of electronegative atoms (F2, ozone, and NO2), polyenes, aromatic molecules (naphthalene, azulene, anthracene, and nitrobenzene), radicals (phenoxy and benzyl), diradicals (o-, m-, and p-benzyne), and transition metal compounds (nickel-acetylene and Cr2). The UNO criterion works well in these cases. Other symmetry breaking solutions, with the possible exception of spatial symmetry, do not appear to be essential to generate the correct active space. In the case of multiple UHF solutions, the natural orbitals of the average UHF density should be used. The problems of the UNO criterion and their potential solutions are discussed: finding the UHF solutions, discontinuities on potential energy surfaces, and inclusion of dynamical electron correlation and generalization to excited states.},

abstract = {A multireference second-order perturbation theory (MRPT2) has been developed which allows the use of reference wave functions with large active spaces and arbitrary configuration selection. Internally contracted configurations are used as a basis for all configuration subspaces of the first-order wave function for which the overlap matrix depends only on the second-order density matrix of the reference function. Some other subspaces which would require the third- or fourth-order density matrices are left uncontracted. This removes bottlenecks of the complete active space second order pertubation theory (CASPT2) caused by the need to construct and diagonalize large overlap matrices. Preliminary applications of the new method for 1,2-dihydronaphthalene (DHN) and free base porphin are presented in which the effect of applying occupancy restrictions in the reference wave function (restricted active space second-order perturbation theory, RASPT2) and reference configuration selection (general MRPT2) on electronic excitation energies is tested. In the case of the S-0-S-1 transition of DHN rapid convergence of the RASPT2 and MRPT2 excitation energies towards the CASPT2 value with increasing number of reference configurations is observed. In the calculations for the lowest five states of porphin all 24 valence pi-orbitals were included in the active space of restricted active space self-consistent field (MCSCF) and MRPT2 calculations. From the RASSCF wave functions different subsets of reference configurations were selected on the basis of their coefficients. In this case convergence of the excitation energies with decreasing selection threshold is found to be rather slow, indicating the need for more elaborate selection schemes. The computed excitation energies are in good agreement with previous CASPT2 results obtained with much smaller active spaces. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics. [S0021-9606(00)30613-4].},

abstract = {The Total Position Spread (TPS) tensor, defined as the second moment cumulant of the position operator, is a key quantity to describe the mobility of electrons in a molecule or an extended system. In the present investigation, the partition of the TPS tensor according to spin variables is derived and discussed. It is shown that, while the spin-summed TPS gives information on charge mobility, the spin-partitioned TPS tensor becomes a powerful tool that provides information about spin fluctuations. The case of the hydrogen molecule is treated, both analytically, by using a 1s Slater-type orbital, and numerically, at Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) level with a V6Z basis set. It is found that, for very large inter-nuclear distances, the partitioned tensor growths quadratically with the distance in some of the low-lying electronic states. This fact is related to the presence of entanglement in the wave function. Non-dimerized open chains described by a model Hubbard Hamiltonian and linear hydrogen chains Hn (n ≥ 2), composed of equally spaced atoms, are also studied at FCI level. The hydrogen systems show the presence of marked maxima for the spin-summed TPS (corresponding to a high charge mobility) when the inter-nuclear distance is about 2 bohrs. This fact can be associated to the presence of a Mott transition occurring in this region. The spin-partitioned TPS tensor, on the other hand, has a quadratical growth at long distances, a fact that corresponds to the high spin mobility in a magnetic system.},

abstract = {When an algorithm in dimension one is extended to dimension d, in nearly every case its computational cost is taken to the power d. This fundamental difficulty is the single greatest impediment to solving many important problems and has been dubbed the curse of dimensionality. For numerical analysis in dimension d, we propose to use a representation for vectors and matrices that generalizes separation of variables while allowing controlled accuracy. Basic linear algebra operations can be performed in this representation using one-dimensional operations, thus bypassing the exponential scaling with respect to the dimension. Although not all operators and algorithms may be compatible with this representation, we believe that many of the most important ones are. We prove that the multiparticle Schr{\"{o}}dinger operator, as well as the inverse Laplacian, can be represented very efficiently in this form. We give numerical evidence to support the conjecture that eigenfunctions inherit this property by computing the ground-state eigenfunction for a simplified Schr{\"{o}}dinger operator with 30 particles. We conjecture and provide numerical evidence that functions of operators inherit this property, in which case numerical operator calculus in higher dimensions becomes feasible.},

The present work shows that one may easily predict whether such a symmetry breaking will take place from the elementary topological H{\"{u}}ckel Hamiltonian which introduces a simple hopping integral t. The demonstration makes use of the simplest representation of the bielectronic repulsion, namely, the Hubbard bielectronic operator, reduced to an on-site repulsion U, and takes benefit of the mirror theorem. A recipe is proposed to determine the relevant t/U ratio for a given exchange-correlation potential. The symmetry-breaking phenomenon first concerns the mixing between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), but it may eventually run on other pairs of mirror orbitals.

abstract = {CAPPED hollow carbon nanotubes1,2 can be modified into nanocomposite fibres by simultaneous opening of the caps (by heating in the presence of air and lead metal) and filling of the interior with an inorganic phase3. To generalize this approach, greater understanding is needed of the reaction mechanism between the tube caps and oxygen. Here we report that the oxidation of carbon nanotubes in air for short durations above about 700-degrees-C results in the etching away of the tube caps and the thinning of tubes through layer-by-layer peeling of the outer layers, starting from the cap region. The oxidation reaction follows an Arrhenius-type relation with an activation energy barrier of about 225 kJ mol-1 in air. Heating of closed nanotubes with an oxide (Pb3O4) in an inert atmosphere lowers the activation barrier for the reaction and opening of the tubes occurs at lower temperatures. Contrary to intuition, however, open tubes are much more difficult to fill with inorganic materials than in the one-step filling of tubes reported previously3. But various other experiments might be possible in the inner nano-cavities of the open tubes such as studies of catalysis and of low-dimensional chemistry and physics.},

We found that the stability of armchair and zigzag nanotubes has different linear dependence with regard to their length, with switches in the most stable chirality occurring at specific lengths for each nanotube series. We explain these dependencies by competing edge and curvature effects. We have found that within each series armchair nanotubes are the most stable at short lengths, while zigzag nanotubes are the most stable at long lengths. These results shed new insights into why (near) armchair nanotubes are the dominant product from catalytic chemical vapor deposition growth, if templating is not used. Paradoxically, the stability of armchair nanotubes at short lengths favors their growth although zigzag nanotubes are more stable at long lengths, resulting in the production of the least stable nanotubes.},

The same algorithm can appear dramatically different when written in the two different vocabularies. In this work, we carefully describe the translation between the two languages in several contexts. First, we describe how to efficiently implement the ab-initio DMRG sweep using a matrix product operator based code, and the equivalence to the original renormalized operator implementation. Next we describe how to implement the general matrix product operator/matrix product state algebra within a pure renormalized operator-based DMRG code. Finally, we discuss two improvements of the ab initio DMRG sweep algorithm motivated by matrix product operator language: Hamiltonian compression, and a sum over operators representation that allows for perfect computational parallelism. The connections and correspondences described here serve to link the future developments with the past, and are important in the efficient implementation of continuing advances in ab initio DMRG and related algorithms.},

The method yields improved potentials in the vicinity of avoided crossings and conical intersections. The theory for computing nuclear energy gradients for MS-CASPT2 and XMS-CASPT2 is also presented and the first implementation of these gradient methods is reported.

To achieve this goal feasible onboard hydrogen storage systems have to be developed. The recent discovery of the high and reversible hydrogen storage capacity of carbon nanotubes makes such a system very promising. In this overview, theoretical predictions and experimental results on the hydrogen uptake of carbon nanotubes and nanofibers are summarized, and we point out that, in order to accelerate the development of carbon nanotubes and nanofibers as a practical hydrogen storage medium in fuel cell-driven vehicles, many efforts have to be made to reproduce and verify the results both theoretically and experimentally, and to investigate their volumetric capacity, cycling characteristics and release behavior.

abstract = {Understanding the structure of aqueous electro- lytes at interfaces is essential for predicting and optimizing device performance for a wide variety of emerging energy and environmental technologies. In this work, we investigate the structure of two common salt solutions, NaCl and KCl, at a hydrophobic interface within narrow carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Using a combination of first-principles and classical molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with molecular orbital analysis, we find that the solvation structure of the cations in the CNTs can deviate substantially from the conventional weakly interacting hydrophobic picture. Instead, interactions between solvated ions and $\pi$ orbitals of the CNTs are found to play a critically important role. Specifically, the ion solvation structure is ultimately determined by a complex interplay between cation−$\pi$ interactions and the intrinsic flexibility of the solvation shell. In the case of K+, these effects result in an unusually strong propensity to partially desolvate and reside closer to the carbon wall than both Na+ and Cl−, in sharp contrast with the known ion ordering at the water−vapor interface.},

The APF-D empirical dispersion model contains nine adjustable parameters that were selected based on a very small training set (15 noble gas dimers and 4 small hydrocarbon dimers), along with two computed atomic properties (ionization potential and effective atomic polarizability) for each element. APF-D accurately describes a large portion of the potential energy surfaces of complexes of noble gas atoms with various diatomic molecules involving a wide range of elements and of dimers of small hydrocarbons, and it reproduces the relative conformational energies of organic molecules.

The role played by finite-size effects and nanotube termination has been analysed by comparing several hydrogen-passivated and not passivated nanotube segments. The dependence of the EA and IP on both the quantum confinement effect, due to the nanotube finite length, and the charge accumulation on the edges, is studied in detail. Also, the EA and IP are compared to the energies of the lowest unoccupied and highest occupied states, respectively, upon increasing the nanotube length. We report a slow convergence with respect to the number of atoms. The effect of nanotube packing in arrays on the electronic properties is eventually elucidated as a function of the intertube distance.},

It is an extension of the previously developed natural atomic orbital (NAO) and natural bond orbital (NBO) methods, and uses only the information contained in the one-particle density matrix. Results are presented for methane and cytosine to indicate that NLMOs closely resemble LMOs obtained by the Boys and Edmiston-Ruedenberg methods, with the exception that the NLMO procedure automatically preserves the MO$\sigma$-$\pi$ separation in planar molecules. The computation time is modest, generally only a small fraction of the SCF computation time. In addition, the derivation of NLMOs from NBOs gives direct insight into the nature of the LMO "delocalization tails," thus enhancing the role of LMOs as a bridge between chemical intuition and molecular wave functions. {\textcopyright} 1985 American Institute of Physics.},

We present general techniques that can be used for the treatment of high-dimensional optimization tasks and time-dependent equations, and connect them to concepts already used in many-body quantum physics. Based on achievements from the past decade, entanglement-based methods, -- developed from different perspectives for different purposes in distinct communities already matured to provide a variety of tools -- can be combined to attack highly challenging problems in quantum chemistry. The aim of the present paper is to give a pedagogical introduction to the theoretical background of this novel field and demonstrate the underlying benefits through numerical applications on a text book example. Among the various optimization tasks we will discuss only those which are connected to a controlled manipulation of the entanglement which is in fact the key ingredient of the methods considered in the paper. The selected topics will be covered according to a series of lectures given on the topic "New wavefunction methods and entanglement optimizations in quantum chemistry" at the Workshop on Theoretical Chemistry, 18 - 21 February 2014, Mariapfarr, Austria.},

abstract = {The density-matrix renormalization group algorithm has emerged as a promising new method in ab initio quantum chemistry. However, many problems still need to be solved before this method can be applied routinely. At the start of such a calculation, the orbitals originating from a preceding quantum chemical calculation must be placed in a specific order on a one-dimensional lattice. This ordering affects the convergence of the density-matrix renormalization group iterations significantly. In this paper, we present two approaches to obtain optimized orderings of the orbitals. First, we use a genetic algorithm to optimize the ordering with respect to a low total electronic energy obtained at a predefined stage of the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm with a given number of total states kept. In addition to that, we derive orderings from the one- and two-electron integrals of our test system. This test molecule is the chromium dimer, which is known to possess a complicated electronic structure. For this molecule, we have carried out calculations for the various orbital orderings obtained. The convergence behavior of the density-matrix renormalization group iterations is discussed in detail.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a comprehensive account of a manifestly size-consistent coupled cluster formalism for a specific state, which is based on a reference function composed of determinants spanning a complete active space (CAS). The method treats all the reference determinants on the same footing and is hence expected to provide uniform description over a wide range of molecular geometry. The combining coefficients are determined by diagonalizing an effective operator in the CAS and are thus completely flexible, not constrained to preassigned values. A separate exponential-type excitation operator is invoked to induce excitations to all the virtual functions from each reference determinant. The linear dependence inherent in this choice of cluster operators is eliminated by invoking suitable sufficiency conditions, which in a transparent manner leads to manifest size extensivity. The use of a CAS also guarantees size consistency. We also discuss the relation of our method with the extant state-specific formalisms. Illustrative applications are presented for systems such as H 4 in rectangular and trapezoidal geometries, the Be–H 2  C 2 v insertion reaction path, the potential energy surface of Li 2 and F 2 , and certain states of CH 2 and C 2 molecules with pronounced multireference character.

This approach corresponds to a "fixed" configurational interaction, but the scheme has preserved the physical simplicity and visuality of the Hartree-Fock approximation.

abstract = {An increasing number of experimental studies have demonstrated that metal or metal oxide nanoparticles confined inside carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit different catalytic activities with respect to the same metals deposited on the CNT exterior walls, with some reactions enhanced, whereas others hindered. In this article, we describe a concept of confinement energy, which enables prediction of the electronic effects on confined catalysis in different reactions. Combining density functional theory calculations and experiments by taking typical transition metals such as Fe, FeCo, RhMn, and Ru as models, we observed stronger strains and deformations within the CNT channels due to different electronic structures and spatial confinement. This leads to downshifted d-band states and consequently the adsorption of molecules such as CO, N2, and O2 is weakened. Thus, the confined space of CNTs provides essentially a unique microenvironment, which shifts the volcano curve of the catalytic activities towards the metals with higher binding energies. The extent of the shift depends on the specific metals and the CNT diameters. This concept generalizes the diverse effects observed in experiments for different reactions and it is anticipated to be applicable to an even broader range of reactions other than redox of metal species, CO hydrogenation, ammonia synthesis and decomposition discussed here.},

abstract = {We have carried out a natural bond orbital analysis of hydrogen bonding in the water dimer for the near-Hartree-Fock wave function of Popkie, Kistenmacher, and Clementi, extending previous studies based on smaller basis sets and less realistic geometry. We find that interactions which may properly be described as "charge transfer" (particularly the n-$\sigma$OH* interaction along the H-bond axis) play a critical role in the formation of the hydrogen bond, and without these interactions the water dimer would be 3-5 kcal/mol repulsive at the observed equilibrium distance. We discuss this result in relationship to Klemperer's general picture of the bonding in van der Waals molecules, and to previous theoretical analyses of hydrogen bonding by the method of Kitaura and Morokuma. {\textcopyright} 1983 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Insensitive energetic materials are desirable for propellants because of the reduced risks involved with their use. The ability to control the decomposition pathways for such materials is also of interest since it leads to optimal performance and controlled energy release. With these goals in mind, molecular structure and total energy calculations are used to investigate the confinement of energetic molecules inside carbon nanostructures. The molecules considered were FOX-7 (1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene), RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-striazine), HMX (octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine), DHT (3,6-di(hydrazino)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine), DiAT (3,6-diazido-1,2,4,5-tetrazine), DAAT (3,3'-azo-bis(6-amino-1,2,4,5-tetrazine)), and five different N-oxides of DAAT (DAATO(n), with n = 1 5). Each of the eleven molecules is encapsulated inside a carbon nanotube (CNT) in order to determine if it is stabilized from such confinement. The calculations predict that each molecule could be stabilized by 32-53 kcal/mol if a CNT of appropriate size is used. FOX-7, RDX, and HMX were also confined between graphene layers, resulting in these molecules being stabilized by 28-40 kcal/mol. The stabilization stems from dispersion interactions between the molecules and carbon nanostructures, Coulombic interactions due to charge transfer, and intermolecular H-bonding in some cases. Overall, each molecule can be stabilized when encapsulated in a carbon nanostructure of appropriate size, thereby reducing its sensitivity.},

abstract = {The Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) has become a powerful numerical method that can be applied to low-dimensional strongly correlated fermionic and bosonic systems. It allows for a very precise calculation of static, dynamic and thermodynamic properties. Its field of applicability has now extended beyond Condensed Matter, and it is now successfully used in Quantum Chemistry, Statistical Mechanics, Quantum Information Theory, Nuclear and High Energy Physics as well. In this article, we briefly review the main aspects of the method and present some of the most relevant applications so as to give an overview on the scope and possibilities of DMRG. We focus on the most important extensions of the method such as the calculation of dynamical properties, the application to classical systems, finite temperature simulations, phonons and disorder, field theory, time-dependent properties and the ab initio calculation of electronic states in molecules. The recent quantum information interpretation, the development of highly accurate time-dependent algorithms and the possibility of using the DMRG as the impurity-solver of the Dynamical Mean Field Method (DMFT) give new insights into its present and potential uses. We review the numerous very recent applications of these techniques where the DMRG has shown to be one of the most reliable and versatile methods in modern computational physics.},

abstract = {Literature data on the storage capacities of hydrogen in carbon nanostructures show a scatter over several orders of magnitude which cannot be solely explained by the limited quantity or purity of these novel nanoscale materials. With this in mind, this article revisits important experiments. Thermal desorption spectroscopy as a quantitative tool to measure the hydrogen storage capacity needs an appropriate calibration using a suitable hydride. Single-walled carbon nanotubes that have been treated by ultra-sonication show hydrogen uptake at room temperature. However, this storage can be assigned to metal particles incorporated during the sonication treatment. Reactive high-energy ball milling of graphite leads to a high hydrogen loading, however the temperatures for hydrogen release are far too high for application. In view of today's knowledge, which is mainly based on experiments with small quantities and poorly characterised samples, carbon nanostructures at around room temperature cannot store the amount of hydrogen required for automotive applications. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method for the 1-d Hubbard model, we have shown that a simple relationship exists between the entropy of the left or right block and dimension of the Hilbert space of that block as well as of the superblock for any fixed accuracy. The information loss during the RG procedure has been investigated and a more rigorous control of the relative error has been proposed based on Kholevo's theory. Our results are also supported by the quantum chemistry version of DMRG applied to various molecules with system lengths up to 60 lattice sites. A sum rule which relates site entropies and the total information generated by the renormalization procedure has also been given which serves as an alternative test of convergence of the DMRG method.},

We present a novel method for accurate “post-DMRG” treatment of dynamic correlation based on the tailored coupled cluster (CC) theory in which the DMRG method is responsible for the proper description of nondynamic correlation, whereas dynamic correlation is incorporated through the framework of the CC theory. We illustrate the potential of this method on prominent multireference systems, in particular, N2 and Cr2 molecules and also oxo-Mn(Salen), for which we have performed the first post-DMRG computations in order to shed light on the energy ordering of the lowest spin states.},

One such technique, full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo, is a useful algorithm that allows exact diagonalization through stochastically sampling determinants. The method derives its utility from the information in the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian, along with a stochastic projected wave function, to find the important parts of Hilbert space. However, the stochastic representation of the wave function is not required to search Hilbert space efficiently, and here we describe a highly efficient deterministic method to achieve chemical accuracy for a wide range of systems, including the difficult Cr$_{2}$ dimer. In addition our method also allows efficient calculation of excited state energies, for which we illustrate with benchmark results for the excited states of C$_{2}$.},

abstract = {In little more than 20 years, the number of applications of the density functional (DF) formalism in chemistry and materials science has grown in an astonishing fashion. The number of publications alone shows that DF calculations make up a huge success story, and many younger colleagues are surprised to learn that the widespread application of density functional methods, particularly in chemistry, began only after 1990. This is indeed unexpected, because the origins are usually traced to the papers ofHohenberg, Kohn, and Sham more than a quarter of acentury earlier.The DF formalism, its applications, and prospects were reviewed for this journal in 1989. About the same time, the combination of DF calculations with molecular dynamics promised to provide an efficient way to study structures and reactions in molecules and extended systems. This paper reviews the develop- ment of density-related methods back to the early years of quantum mechanics and follows the breakthrough in their application after 1990. The two examples from biochemistry and materials science are among the many current applications that were simply far beyond expectations in 1990. The reasons why—50 years after its modern formulation and after two decades of rapid expansion— some of the most cited practitioners in the field are concerned about its future are discussed.},

Two types of zero-order Hamiltonians are proposed, both are bielectronic, incorporating the interactions between electrons in the active orbitals, therefore introducing a rational balance between the zero-order wave function and the outer-space. The use of Dyall's Hamiltonian, which puts the active electrons in a fixed core field, and of a partially contracted formalism seems a promising compromise. The formalism is generalizable to multireference spaces which are parts of a CAS.

Different types of low-lying vertical excitation energies are computed using the same geometries and TZVP basis set as in the original work. The previously published coupled cluster CC3 results are used as a reference. The complete active space second order perturbation theory (CASPT2) results, as well as the results of second order N- electron valence perturbation theory (NEVPT2) (both in their single-state variants) are evaluated against this reference set, which includes 153 singlet and 72 triplet vertical transition energies. NEVPT2 calculations are carried out in two variants: the partially contracted (PC) and the strongly contracted (SC) scheme. The statistical evaluation with respect to CC3 is found to be similar for both: the mean unsigned deviations is 0.28 eV for singlets and 0.16 eV for triplets for PC-NEVPT2, while it is 0.23 and 0.17 eV for SC-NEVPT2, respectively. Further analysis has shown that deficiencies in the zeroth-order wave functions, in particular for the subset of $\pi$ →$\pi$* singlet excitations, are responsible for the largest deviations from CC3. Those states have either a charge transfer or an ionic character. For the remaining singlet and all triplet excitations the general trend was established that NEVPT2 tends to slightly overestimate excitation energies while CASPT2 slightly underestimates them. However, overall, both methods are of very similar accuracy provided that the IPEA shift is used in the CASPT2 method. Interestingly, the conclusions reached in this study are independent of the orbital canonicalization scheme used in the NEVPT2 calculation.},

abstract = {The metal-insulator transition is investigated in the case of linear chains described by a one-electron H{{\"{u}}}ckel Hamiltonian. In these systems, the transition is a consequence of a dimerization of the chain bond length, which induces a similar dimerization of the hopping integral. Three indicators of the chain character are considered: The highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gap, the polarizability, and the localization tensor. In the case of even open chains, the behavior of the large chains depends in a crucial way on the alternating structure of the hopping integrals. If the ending atoms of the chain are weakly bonded to their neighbors, the energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian shows two quasidegenerated eigenvalues, and all the indicators would predict a (spurious) metallic behavior. It is shown that if the corresponding eigenvectors are removed from the Hamiltonian, the ordinary insulating behavior of alternating chains is recovered.},

abstract = {Noncovalent interactions involving aromatic rings, which include $\pi$-stacking interactions, anion-$\pi$ interactions, and XH-$\pi$ interactions, among others, are ubiquitous in chemical and biochemical systems. Despite dramatic advances in our understanding of these interactions over the past decade, many aspects of these noncovalent interactions have only recently been uncovered, with many questions remaining. We summarize our computational studies aimed at understanding the impact of substituents and heteroatoms on these noncovalent interactions. In particular, we discuss our local, direct interaction model of substituent effects in $\pi$-stacking interactions. In this model, substituent effects are dominated by electrostatic interactions of the local dipoles associated with the substituents and the electric field of the other ring. The implications of the local nature of substituent effects on $\pi$-stacking interactions in larger systems are discussed, with examples given for complexes with carbon nanotubes and a small graphene model, as well as model stacked discotic systems. We also discuss related issues involving the interpretation of electrostatic potential (ESP) maps. Although ESP maps are widely used in discussions of noncovalent interactions, they are often misinterpreted. Next, we provide an alternative explanation for the origin of anion-$\pi$ interactions involving substituted benzenes and N-heterocycles, and show that these interactions are well-described by simple models based solely on charge-dipole interactions. Finally, we summarize our recent work on the physical nature of substituent effects in XH-$\pi$ interactions. Together, these results paint a more complete picture of noncovalent interactions involving aromatic rings and provide a firm conceptual foundation for the rational exploitation of these interactions in a myriad of chemical contexts.},

@article{Werner1988,
abstract = {A new internally contracted direct multiconfiguration-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) method is described which allows the use of much larger reference spaces than any previous MRCI method. The configurations with two electrons in the external orbital space are generated by applying pair excitation operators to the reference wave function as a whole, while the singly external and internal configurations are standard un contracted spin eigenfunctions. A new efficient and simple method for the calculation of the coupling coefficients is used, which is well suited for vector machines, and allows the recalculation of all coupling coefficients each time they are needed. The vector H{\textperiodcentered}c is computed partly in a nonorthogonal configuration basis. In order to test the accuracy of the internally contracted wave functions, benchmark calculations have been performed for F-, H2 0, NHz, CH2, CH3, OH, NO, N2, and 0z at various geometries. The deviations of the energies obtained with internally contracted and un contracted MRCI wave functions are mostly smaller than 1 mH and typically 3-5 times smaller than the deviations between the uncontracted MRCI and the full CI. Dipole moments, electric dipole polarizabilities, and electronic dipole transition moments calculated with un contracted and contracted MRCI wave functions also are found to be in close agreement. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated in large scale calculations for the CN, NH3, CO2 , and Cr2 molecules. In these calculations up to 3088 reference configurations and up to 154 orbitals were employed. The biggest calculation is equivalent to an uncontracted MRCI with more than 78 million configurations.},

@article{Zhang2016,
abstract = {In this work we propose a novel approach to solve the Schr\"{o}dinger equation which combines projection onto the ground state with a path-filtering truncation scheme. The resulting projector configuration interaction (PCI) approach realizes a deterministic version of the full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method [Booth, G. H.; Thom, A. J. W.; Alavi, A. J. Chem. Phys. 2009, 131, 054106]. To improve upon the linearized imaginary-time propagator, we develop an optimal projector scheme based on an exponential Chebyshev expansion in the limit of an infinite imaginary time step. After writing the exact projector as a path integral in determinant space, we introduce a path filtering procedure that truncates the size of the determinantal basis and approximates the Hamiltonian. The path filtering procedure is controlled by one real threshold that determines the accuracy of the PCI energy and is not biased towards any determinant. Therefore, the PCI approach can equally well describe static and dynamic electron correlation. This point is illustrated in benchmark computation on N$_2$ at both equilibrium and stretched geometries. In both cases, the PCI achieves chemical accuracy with wave functions that contain less than 0.5% of the full CI space. We also report computations on the ground state of C$_2$ with up to quaduple-$\zeta$ basis sets and wave functions as large as 200 million determinants, which allow a direct comparison of the PCI, FCIQMC, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods. The size of the PCI wave function grows modestly with the number of unoccupied orbitals and its accuracy may be tuned to match that of FCIQMC and DMRG.},

abstract = {Applying the density matrix renormalization group (DRMG) method to a nonempirical valence bond (VB) model Hamiltonian, we studied polyacene oligomers of different lengths in the strong electron correlation limit. Geometrical optimizations were performed for the lowest singlet and triplet states of oligomers up to [40]-acene, and a convergence of the bond lengths toward the polymer limit is observed in the interior of the oligomer. For large oligomers, as well as for the polymer, the ground state can be reasonably determined to be a singlet. Furthermore, a high similarity between the singlet geometries and triplet geometries suggests an open-shell character for the singlet ground state. A reasonable speculation of the soliton-antisoliton pair character of the singlet ground state was supported by a spin distribution analysis of the triplet state wave function of large oligomers, with each of the two solitons being broadly delocalized over the upper or bottom edge of the oligomers, respectively.},

These bases are then applied to a set of molecules containing up to two heavy atoms to obtain their LCAO-MO-SCF energies.

abstract = {The strongly contracted variant of second-order N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2) is an efficient perturbative method to treat dynamic correlation without the problems of intruder states or level shifts, while the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) provides the capability to address static correlation in large active spaces. We present a combination of the DMRG and strongly contracted NEVPT2 (DMRG-SC-NEVPT2) that uses an efficient algorithm to compute high-order reduced-density matrices from DMRG wave functions. The capabilities of DMRG-SC-NEVPT2 are demonstrated on calculations of the chromium dimer potential energy curve at the basis set limit, and the excitation energies of a trimer model of poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV(n = 3)).},

This leads to an interaction energy of −5.1 kcal/mol, exclusive of vibrational zero‐point considerations, and is in good agreement with experimental measurements of −5.4±0.7 kcal/mol. Inclusion of an approximate adjustment for the basis set superposition error via the Boys/Bernardi counterpoise correction was found to substantially improve agreement with $\Delta$E ∞, our estimate of the complete basis set interaction energy, at the both the SCF and correlated levels for basis sets that were lacking in sufficient near‐valence diffuse functions. For diffuse‐function‐augmented basis sets, application of the CP correction was found to sometimes worsen agreement with $\Delta$E ∞.},

Our calculations using hybrid functionals show that the only true exceptions to the zone folding predictions are the (4,0) and (5,0) SWNT. The remaining chiral SWNT are semiconducting with band gaps that can be as large as 1.7 eV. However, the calculated energy band gaps are significantly smaller than those predicted by the zone folding scheme. This difference is primarily attributed to the sigma-pi hybridization present in such narrow SWNT.},

The computed S(2) and S(1) energy profiles do not show any avoided crossing feature along the S(1) reaction path and maintain an energy gap >20 kcal small middle dotmol(-1). In addition, the analysis of the charge distribution shows that there is no qualitative change in the S(2) and S(1) electronic structure along the path. Thus, the S(1) state maintains a prevalent ionic (hole-pair) character whereas the S(2) state maintains a covalent (dot-dot) character. These results, together with the analysis of the S(1) reaction coordinate, support a two-state, two-mode model of the photoisomerization that constitutes a substantial revision of the previously proposed models.},

abstract = {By means of the Rutherford method it is found that in zigzag carbon nanotubes with an even number n=2j of hexagons in a tube ring the gap between occupied and empty single-electron levels disappears. The frontier level is shown to be at least doubly degenerate. The reason for the loss of the zero level (for n=2j) upon reaching the infinite length limit is discussed. The existence of a lot of states, specific for finite nanotubes, with the energy very close to the Fermi level is shown, and the number of these states is estimated. The existence of a narrow (of order 10(-4) eV) conduction band, formed by edge states, is demonstrated in tight binding approximation. If the Coulomb interaction is taken into account, the half-filled degenerate pi-electronic level continues to exist. The open shell Hartree-Fock theory demonstrates the degenerate configuration splitting onto three equidistant terms: two singlets with the seniority numbers 0 and 1, and the lowest triplet in accordance with the Hund rule. The behavior of the single-electron gap is alike for all three terms: the gap is of the order 0.2-0.01 eV. The Rutherford method gives analytical results for armchair nanotubes as well, which explains the gap oscillations as a function of the tube length with a period of three rings. Application of the degenerate open shell Hartree-Fock theory supports this explanation.},

Using the unbiased density-matrix renormalization group algorithm we calculate the charge gaps for different widths and interaction strengths and compare them with mean-field results. It turns out that the gaps are much smaller in the former case due to the accurate treatment of quantum fluctuations. We also determine the entanglement patterns between the electrons and the spectrum of subsystem density matrices. We point out that in the absence of the electron-electron interaction only short-range entanglement is present in the system, while for stronger interaction long-range entanglement develops between the electrons on the same edge and between the two edges. Our findings are relevant for understanding deviations between gap values in different recent experiments and the applicability of the $\pi$-band Hubbard model in general.},

abstract = {Nowadays, computer simulations have become a standard tool in essentially all fields of chemistry, condensed matter physics, and materials science. In order to keep up with state-of-the-art experiments and the ever growing complexity of the investigated problems, there is a constantly increasing need for simulations of more realistic, i.e., larger, model systems with improved accuracy. In many cases, the availability of sufficiently efficient interatomic potentials providing reliable energies and forces has become a serious bottleneck for performing these simulations. To address this problem, currently a paradigm change is taking place in the development of interatomic potentials. Since the early days of computer simulations simplified potentials have been derived using physical approximations whenever the direct application of electronic structure methods has been too demanding. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) now offer an alternative approach for the representation of potential-energy surfaces by fitting large data sets from electronic structure calculations. In this perspective, the central ideas underlying these ML potentials, solved problems and remaining challenges are reviewed along with a discussion of their current applicability and limitations.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes1 are predicted to be metallic or semiconducting depending on their diameter and the helicity of the arrangement of graphitic rings in their walls2, 3, 4, 5. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) offers the potential to probe this prediction, as it can resolve simultaneously both atomic structure and the electronic density of states. Previous STM studies of multi-walled nanotubes6, 7, 8, 9 and single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs)10 have provided indications of differing structures and diameter-dependent electronic properties, but have not revealed any explicit relationship between structure and electronic properties. Here we report STM measurements of the atomic structure and electronic properties of SWNTs. We are able to resolve the hexagonal-ring structure of the walls, and show that the electronic properties do indeed depend on diameter and helicity. We find that the SWNT samples exhibit many different structures, with no one species dominating.},

By analyzing the behavior of von Neumann entropy we have found criteria that help to fasten convergence. An initialization procedure has been developed which maximizes the Kullback-Leibler entropy and extends the active space in a dynamical fashion. The dynamically extended active space procedure reduces significantly the effective system size during the first half-sweep and accelerates the speed of convergence of momentum space DMRG and quantum chemistry DMRG to a great extent. The effect of lattice site ordering on the number of block states to be kept during the RG procedure is also investigated.},

@article{Grimme2010,
abstract = {The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15%-40% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C(6) coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems.},

abstract = {A new method is proposed to calculate bond energies and equilibrium distances in atom-molecule van der Waals complexes which arises from a balancing between long-range attraction and asymptotic tail of the repulsion. The method, based on correlation formulas between the polarizability of the interacting partners and the main interaction parameters, is an extension of an approach originally developed for atom-atom cases. The basic idea exploits the concept of bond polarizability additivity to represent both the molecular repulsion, in terms of a size which is mainly ascribed to the molecular bonds nearest to the probe atom, and the molecular attraction as due to multi-dispersion centers delocalized on the molecular frame. The method, mainly tested on hydrocarbon-rare gas complexes, can be considered as the starting point for the study of systems of higher complexity. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND: The Avogadro project has developed an advanced molecule editor and visualizer designed for cross-platform use in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, bioinformatics, materials science, and related areas. It offers flexible, high quality rendering, and a powerful plugin architecture. Typical uses include building molecular structures, formatting input files, and analyzing output of a wide variety of computational chemistry packages. By using the CML file format as its native document type, Avogadro seeks to enhance the semantic accessibility of chemical data types. RESULTS: The work presented here details the Avogadro library, which is a framework providing a code library and application programming interface (API) with three-dimensional visualization capabilities; and has direct applications to research and education in the fields of chemistry, physics, materials science, and biology. The Avogadro application provides a rich graphical interface using dynamically loaded plugins through the library itself. The application and library can each be extended by implementing a plugin module in C++ or Python to explore different visualization techniques, build/manipulate molecular structures, and interact with other programs. We describe some example extensions, one which uses a genetic algorithm to find stable crystal structures, and one which interfaces with the PackMol program to create packed, solvated structures for molecular dynamics simulations. The 1.0 release series of Avogadro is the main focus of the results discussed here. CONCLUSIONS: Avogadro offers a semantic chemical builder and platform for visualization and analysis. For users, it offers an easy-to-use builder, integrated support for downloading from common databases such as PubChem and the Protein Data Bank, extracting chemical data from a wide variety of formats, including computational chemistry output, and native, semantic support for the CML file format. For developers, it can be easily extended via a powerful plugin mechanism to support new features in organic chemistry, inorganic complexes, drug design, materials, biomolecules, and simulations.

For systems with both cationic and anionic sites, this leads to fractional electron transfer, even when standard basis sets are used, and thus a qualitative incorrect description of the electronic structure. Exchange functionals without Hartree−Fock exchange display the largest effects, but hybrid functionals also show the phenomenon, except for strongly bound anions. The source of the error is the incorrect long-range behavior of the exchange potential and can be avoided by employing the long-range correction method.

Hectic materials research is going on throughout the world with various adsorption mechanisms to increase the storage capacity. It was observed that physisorption proves to be an effective way for this purpose. Some of the materials in this race include graphite, zeolite, carbon fibers and nanotubes. Among all these, the versatile material carbon nanotube (CNT) has a number of favorable points like porous nature, high surface area, hollowness, high stability and light weight, which facilitate the hydrogen adsorption in both outer and inner portions. In this work we have considered armchair (5,5), zig zag (10,0) and chiral tubes (8,2) and (6,4) with and without structural defects to study the physisorption of hydrogen on the surface of carbon nanotubes using DFT calculations. For two different H2 configurations, adsorption binding energies are estimated both for defect free and defected carbon nanotubes. We could observe larger adsorption energies for the configuration in which the hydrogen molecular axis perpendicular to the hexagonal carbon ring than for parallel to C–C bond configuration corresponding to the defect free nanotubes. For defected tubes the adsorption energies are calculated for various configurations such as molecular axis perpendicular to a defect site octagon and parallel to C–C bond of octagon and another case where the axis perpendicular to hexagon in defected tube. The adsorption binding energy values are compared with defect free case. The results are discussed in detail for hydrogen storage applications.},

Ab-initio SCF-MO wave functions were calcd. for compds. of type CH3X and LiX (X = F, OH, NH2, CH3, BH2, BeH, Li, H) in a variety of basis sets to illustrate the generality of the method, and to compare the natural populations with results of Mulliken anal., d. integration, and empirical measures of ionic character. Natural populations gave a satisfactory description of these mols., and provided a unified treatment of covalent and extreme ionic limits at modest computational cost. [on SciFinder (R)]},

abstract = {The properties of protonated water systems in nano-confinement differ significantly from its bulk counterparts mainly due to the geometric constraint and nature of water-medium interactions. Herein, we have investigated the structure, vibrational spectra and proton transfer energetics of Zundel cation (ZC) under the confinement of boron-nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) by varying the degree of confinement in a systematic manner. Our results based on dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) based methods reveal that the structure of ZC is significantly modified under the confinement and the nature of interaction largely depends on the diameter of BNNT. The ZC effectively forms hydrogen bonds through Hwater⋯NBNNT with BNNT. Among the BNNTs considered in the present study, the maximum interaction energy of ZC and minimum energy barrier for proton transfer are observed for the case of BNNT(5,5). This implies that this particular nanotube can facilitate the proton to easily hop between water molecules of a confined protonated water system.},

While density-functional theory (DFT) is widely applied in this area, the sometimes severe limitations of its currently available approximate realizations often preclude its application as a predictive theory. Here, we review the foundations of DFT applied to open-shell systems, both within the nonrelativistic and the relativistic framework. In particular, we provide an in-depth discussion of the exact theory, with a focus on the role of the spin density and possibilities for targeting specific spin states. It turns out that different options exist for setting up Kohn-Sham DFT schemes for open-shell systems, which imply different definitions of the exchange-correlation energy functional and lead to different exact conditions on this functional. Finally, we suggest some possible directions for future developments.},

The polyacenes and cyclacenes have geometries consisting of two fully delocalized nonalternating ribbons joined by relatively long bonds. Polyacenes are predicted to have smaller band gaps than the corresponding polyenes and triplet ground states for nine or more benzene rings. The fully delocalized nonalternating nature of polyacenes differs from the bond alternation resulting from Peierls distortion in polyenes. The differences are rationalized in terms of a simple MO model, and the results are compared to extensive prior theoretical work in the literature.

By introducing the "natural orbitals" diagonalizing the generalized first-order density matrix, the total wave functions may also be brought to principal form. If the basis contains M one-electron functions, the singlet and triplet wave functions contain respectively M(M+1)/2 and M(M-1)/2 configurations, but the transformation to natural orbitals reduces the number of terms to M and [M/2], respectively. The natural expansion having the best convergence is also characterized by another important extremum property. The approximate wave function of rank r having the smallest quadratic deviation from the exact eigenfunction is obtained by interrupting the natural expansion of the eigenfunction after r terms and renormalizing the result. For the singlet state, the wave function of rank two and signature zero has a special importance as giving a simple extension of the visual one-electron picture to include a large part of the correlation effects. The theory is illustrated by some results on helium obtained by using radial configuration interaction.},

Within this approximation, the CI coefficients are fully optimized, thereby accounting for the coupling between orbital rotations and CI coefficients to higher order than in previous treatments. Additional transformations among the internal orbitals and their associated one‐ and two‐electron integrals are performed which amounts to treating the rotations among internal orbitals to higher than second order. These extra steps are cheap compared to the four index transformation performed in each iteration, but lead to a remarkable enhancement of convergence and overall efficiency. In all calculations attempted to date, convergence has been achieved in at most three iterations. The energy has been observed to converge better than quadratically from the first iteration even when the initial Hessian matrix has many negative eigenvalues.},

abstract = {Ever since the conversion of the 11-cis retinal chromophore to its all-trans form in rhodopsin was identified as the primary photochemical event in vision, experimentalists and theoreticians have tried to unravel the molecular details of this process. The high quantum yield of 0.65 (ref. 2), the production of the primary ground-state rhodopsin photoproduct within a mere 200 fs (refs 3-7), and the storage of considerable energy in the first stable bathorhodopsin intermediate all suggest an unusually fast and efficient photoactivated one-way reaction. Rhodopsin's unique reactivity is generally attributed to a conical intersection between the potential energy surfaces of the ground and excited electronic states enabling the efficient and ultrafast conversion of photon energy into chemical energy. But obtaining direct experimental evidence for the involvement of a conical intersection is challenging: the energy gap between the electronic states of the reacting molecule changes significantly over an ultrashort timescale, which calls for observational methods that combine high temporal resolution with a broad spectral observation window. Here we show that ultrafast optical spectroscopy with sub-20-fs time resolution and spectral coverage from the visible to the near-infrared allows us to follow the dynamics leading to the conical intersection in rhodopsin isomerization. We track coherent wave-packet motion from the photoexcited Franck-Condon region to the photoproduct by monitoring the loss of reactant emission and the subsequent appearance of photoproduct absorption, and find excellent agreement between the experimental observations and molecular dynamics calculations that involve a true electronic state crossing. Taken together, these findings constitute the most compelling evidence to date for the existence and importance of conical intersections in visual photochemistry.},

Based on these analysis a sequence of polarization consistent basis sets are proposed which should be suitable for systematically improving Hartree–Fock and density functional energies. Analogous to the correlation consistent basis sets designed for correlation energies, higher angular momentum functions are included based on their energetical importance. In contrast to the correlation consistent basis sets, however, the importance of higher angular momentum functions decreases approximately geometric, rather than arithmetic. It is shown that it is possible to design a systematic sequence of basis sets for which results converge monotonic to the Hartree–Fock limit. The primitive basis sets can be contracted by a general contraction scheme. It is found that polarization consistent basis sets provide a faster convergence than the correlation consistent basis sets. Results obtained with polarization consistent basis sets can be further improved by extrapolation.},

Tools to quantify and visualize electron delocalization help to understand, teach, and predict chemical reactivity.

Our electron delocalization range function EDR (r⃗;u) quantifies the degree to which electrons at point r⃗ in a calculated wavefunction delocalize over length scale u. Its predictions are physically reasonable. For example, EDR (r⃗;u=0.25 bohr ) is close to one at points r⃗ in the cores of first-row atoms, consistent with the localization of core electrons to $\sim$0.25 bohr. EDR (r⃗;u=1 bohr ) is close to one at points r⃗ in typical covalent bonds, consistent with electrons delocalizing over the length of the bond. Our approach provides a rich representation of atomic shell structure; covalent and ionic bonding; the delocalization of excited states, defects, and solvated electrons; metallic and insulating systems; and bond stretching and strong correlation.},

For some base pairs, Coupled-Cluster corrections with inclusion of noniterative triple contributions (CCSD(T)) are given. The calculations are compared with selected medium quality methods. The PW91 DFT functional with the 6-31G basis set matches well the RI-MP2/CBS absolute interaction energies and reproduces the relative values of base pairing energies with a maximum relative error of 2.6 kcal/mol when applied with Becke3LYP-optimized geometries. The Becke3LYP DFT functional underestimates the interaction energies by few kcal/mol with relative error of 2.2 kcal/mol. Very good performance of nonpolarizable Cornell et al. force field is confirmed and this indirectly supports the view that H-bonded base pairs are primarily stabilized by electrostatic interactions.},

abstract = {In contrast to the original Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism, we propose a density functional theory (DFT) with fractional orbital occupations for the study of ground states of many-electron systems, wherein strong static correlation is shown to be described. Even at the simplest level represented by the local density approximation (LDA), our resulting DFT-LDA is shown to improve upon KS-LDA for multi-reference systems, such as dissociation of H2 and N2, and twisted ethylene, while performing similar to KS-LDA for single-reference systems, such as reaction energies and equilibrium geometries. Because of its computational efficiency (similar to KS-LDA), this DFT-LDA is applied to the study of the singlet-triplet energy gaps (ST gaps) of acenes, which are “challenging problems” for conventional electronic structure methods due to the presence of strong static correlation effects. Our calculated ST gaps are in good agreement with the existing experimental and high-level ab initio data. The ST gaps are shown to decrease monotonically with the increase of chain length, and become vanishingly small (within 0.1 kcal/mol) in the limit of an infinitely large polyacene. In addition, based on our calculated active orbital occupation numbers, the ground states for large acenes are shown to be polyradical singlets.},

abstract = {In this proof-of-principle study, we apply tensor decomposition techniques to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) wavefunction in order to approximate the wavefunction parameters efficiently and to reduce the overall computational effort. For this purpose, the wavefunction ansatz is formulated in an occupation number vector representation that ensures antisymmetry. If the canonical product format tensor decomposition is then applied, the Hamiltonian and the wavefunction can be cast into a multilinear product form. As a consequence, the number of wavefunction parameters does not scale to the power of the number of particles (or orbitals) but depends on the rank of the approximation and linearly on the number of particles. The degree of approximation can be controlled by a single threshold for the rank reduction procedure required in the algorithm. We demonstrate that using this approximation, the FCI Hamiltonian matrix can be stored with N5 scaling. The error of the approximation that is introduced is below Millihartree for a threshold of ϵ = 10−4 and no convergence problems are observed solving the FCI equations iteratively in the new format. While promising conceptually, all effort of the algorithm is shifted to the required rank reduction procedure after the contraction of the Hamiltonian with the coefficient tensor. At the current state, this crucial step is the bottleneck of our approach and even for an optimistic estimate, the algorithm scales beyond N10 and future work has to be directed towards reduction-free algorithms.},

We have analyzed the change of the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$ -spin electronic gaps under the influence of an electric field applied along the nanotube axis. The half-metallic behavior, in which the electronic gap is zero for one spin flavor and nonzero for the other, is obtained for a critical electric field of 3.0/w V/, where w is the length of the nanotube. This critical field is the same as that predicted for graphene nanoribbons. By a detailed analysis of the spin structure of the ground state, we show the relevance of the edge states, electronic states spatially localized at the carbon atoms of the nanotube boundaries, on the on-set of half-metallicity, and on the magnetic properties of the finite semiconducting zigzag nanotubes. {{\textcopyright}} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {All-electron static and time-dependent DFT electronic calculations, with complete geometrical optimization, are performed on tubular molecules up to C(210)H(20) that are finite sections of the (5,5) metallic single wall carbon nanotube with hydrogen termination at the open ends. We find pronounced C-C bond reconstruction at the tube ends; this initiates bond alternation that propagates into the tube centers. For the especially low band gap molecules C(120)H(20), C(150)H(20), and C(180)H(20), alternation increases, and a second nearly isoenergic structural isomer of different alternation is found. A small residual C-C bond alternation and band gap may be present in the infinite tube. The van Hove band gap forms quickly with length, while the metallic Fermi point (at the crossing of linear bands) forms very slowly with length. There are no end-localized states at energies near the Fermi energy. The HOMO-LUMO gap and the lowest singlet excited state, whose energies show a periodicity with length as previously calculated, are optically forbidden. However, each molecule shows an intense visible "charge transfer" transition, not present in the infinite tube, whose energy varies smoothly with length; this transition should be an identifying signature for these molecules. The static axial polarizability per unit length increases rapidly with N as the "charge transfer" transition moves into the infrared; this indicates increasing metallic character. However, the ionization potential, electron affinity, chemical hardness, and relative energetic stability all show the length periodicity seen in the HOMO-LUMO gap, in contrast to the optical "charge transfer" transition and the static axial polarizability. These periodicities, due to a one-dimensional quantum size effect as originally modeled by Coulson in 1938, nevertheless cancel in the calculated Fermi energy, which varies smoothly toward a predicted bulk work function near 3.9 eV. A detailed study of C(190)H(20) with up to eight extra electrons or holes shows the total energy is closely fit by a simple classical charging model, as is commonly applied to metallic clusters.},

abstract = {One of the key challenges of quantum-chemical multi-configuration methods is the necessity to manually select orbitals for the active space. This selection requires both expertise and experience and can therefore impose severe limitations on the applicability of this most general class of ab initio methods. A poor choice of the active orbital space may yield even qualitatively wrong results. This is obviously a severe problem, especially for wave function methods that are designed to be systematically improvable. Here, we show how the iterative nature of the density matrix renormalization group combined with its capability to include up to about one hundred orbitals in the active space can be exploited for a systematic assessment and selection of active orbitals. These benefits allow us to implement an automated approach for active orbital space selection, which can turn multi-configuration models into black box approaches.},

The ILJ potential eliminates most of the inadequacies at short- and long-range of the LJ model. Further reliability tests have been performed by comparing calculated vibrational spacings with experimental values and calculated interaction energies at short-range with those obtained from the inversion of gaseous transport properties. The analysis, extended also to systems involving ions, suggests that the ILJ potential model can be used to estimate the behavior of unknown systems and can help to assess the different role of the leading interaction components. Moreover, due to its simple formulation, the physically reliable ILJ model appears to be particularly useful for molecular dynamics simulations of both neutral and ionic systems.},

abstract = {The qualitative difference between insulators and metals stems from the nature of the low-lying excitations, but also--according to Kohn's theory [W. Kohn, Phys. Rev. 133, A171 (1964)]--from a different organization of the electrons in their ground state: electrons are localized in insulators and delocalized in metals. We adopt a quantitative measure of such localization, by means of a "localization length" lambda, finite in insulators and divergent in metals. We perform simulations over a one-dimensional binary alloy model, in a tight-binding scheme. In the ordered case the model is either a band insulator or a band metal, whereas in the disordered case it is an Anderson insulator. The results show indeed a localized/delocalized ground state in the insulating/metallic cases, as expected. More interestingly, we find a significant difference between the two insulating cases: band versus Anderson. The insulating behavior is due to two very different scattering mechanisms; we show that the corresponding values of lambda differ by a large factor for the same alloy composition. We also investigate the organization of the electrons in the many body ground state from the viewpoint of the density matrices and of Boys' theory of localization.},

In contrast, polynitrogen compounds comprising only nitrogen atoms are rare, and no molecular crystal made of these compounds has been prepared. Here, we predict the existence of such a molecular solid, consisting of N8 molecules, that is metastable even at ambient pressure. In the solid state, the N8 monomers retain the same structure and bonding pattern as those they adopt in the gas phase. The interactions that bind N8 molecules together are weak van der Waals and electrostatic forces. The solid is, according to calculations, more stable than a previously reported polymeric nitrogen solid, including at low pressure (below 20 GPa). The structure and properties of the N8 molecular crystal are discussed and a possible preparation strategy is suggested.},

The calculations are performed using the complete active space self-consistent field method and second-order n-electron valence perturbation theory. We present a systematic way for the selection of the active space in order to have a balanced description of the wave function as the size of the system increases. Moreover, we provide didactic insight into the failure of an approach based on a minimal active space. We find that the ground state is an open-shell singlet and its multireference character increases progressively with n. The singlet–triplet gap decreases as a function of the system size and approaches a finite positive value for the limit n → ∞. Finally, an analysis based on the one-particle reduced density matrix suggests a polyradical character for the largest cyclacenes.},

abstract = {We report here the results for an ab initio approach to obtain the parameters needed for molecular simulations using a polarizable force field. These parameters consist of the atomic charges, polarizabilities, and radii. The former two are readily obtained using methods reported previously (van Duijnen and Swart, J Phys Chem A 1998, 102, 2399; Swart et al. J Comput Chem 2001, 22, 79), whereas here we report a new approach for obtaining atomic second-order radii (SOR), which is based on second-order atomic moments in scaled Voronoi cells. These parameters are obtained from quantum- chemistry calculations on the monomers, and used without further adaptation directly for intermolecular interactions. The approach works very well as shown here for four dimers, where high-level coupled cluster with singles and doubles, and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) and density functional theory (DFT) Swart-Sola `-Bickelhaupt functional including Grimme's dispersion correction (SSB-D) reference data are available for comparison. The energy surfaces for the three methods are very similar, which is also the case for the interaction between a water molecule with either a chloride anion or a sodium cation. These latter systems had previously been used to criticize Thole's damped point-dipole method, but here we show that with the correct use of the method, it is perfectly able to describe the intermolecular interactions. This is most obvious for the induced dipole moment as function of the chloride–oxygen distance, where the direct (discrete) reaction field results are virtually indistinguishable from those obtained at CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ.},

Here I report the preparation of a new type of finite carbon structure consisting of needle-like tubes. Produced using an arc-discharge evaporation method similar to that used for fullerene synthesis, the needles grow at the negative end of the electrode used for the arc discharge. Electron microscopy reveals that each needle comprises coaxial tubes of graphitic sheets, ranging in number from 2 up to about 50. On each tube the carbon-atom hexagons are arranged in a helical fashion about the needle axis. The helical pitch varies from needle to needle and from tube to tube within a single needle. It appears that this helical structure may aid the growth process. The formation of these needles, ranging from a few to a few tens of nanometres in diameter, suggests that engineering of carbon structures should be possible on scales considerably greater than those relevant to the fullerenes.},

From the molecular Hamiltonian, using and discussing the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we arrive to the Hartree and Hartree-Fock equations for the electronic problem. Special emphasis is placed in the most relevant mathematical aspects of the theoretical derivation of the final equations, as well as in the results regarding the existence and uniqueness of their solutions. All Hartree-Fock versions with different spin restrictions are systematically extracted from the general case, thus providing a unifying framework. Then, the discretization of the one-electron orbitals space is reviewed and the Roothaan-Hall formalism introduced. This leads to a exposition of the basic underlying concepts related to the construction and selection of Gaussian basis sets, focusing in algorithmic efficiency issues. Finally, we close the review with a section in which the most relevant modern developments (specially those related to the design of linear-scaling methods) are commented and linked to the issues discussed. The whole work is intentionally introductory and rather self-contained, so that it may be useful for non experts that aim to use quantum chemical methods in interdisciplinary applications. Moreover, much material that is found scattered in the literature has been put together here to facilitate comprehension and to serve as a handy reference.},

The calculated heats of formation of the gas-phase molecules/ions at 0 K are DeltaHf(N3(2Pi)) = 109.2, DeltaHf(N3-(1sigma+)) = 47.4, DeltaHf(N5-(1A1')) = 62.3, and DeltaHf(N5+(1A1)) = 353.3 kcal/mol with an estimated error bar of +/-1 kcal/mol. For comparison purposes, the error in the calculated bond energy for N2 is 0.72 kcal/mol. Born-Haber cycle calculations, using estimated lattice energies and the adiabatic ionization potentials of the anions and electron affinities of the cations, enable reliable stability predictions for the hypothetical N5(+)N3(-) and N5(+)N5(-) salts. The calculations show that neither salt can be stabilized and that both should decompose spontaneously into N3 radicals and N2. This conclusion was experimentally confirmed for the N5(+)N3(-) salt by low-temperature metathetical reactions between N5SbF6 and alkali metal azides in different solvents, resulting in violent reactions with spontaneous nitrogen evolution. It is emphasized that one needs to use adiabatic ionization potentials and electron affinities instead of vertical potentials and affinities for salt stability predictions when the formed radicals are not vibrationally stable. This is the case for the N5 radicals where the energy difference between vertical and adiabatic potentials amounts to about 100 kcal/mol per N5.},

@article{Wouters2014b,
abstract = {The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) has become an indispensable numerical tool to find exact eigenstates of finite-size quantum systems with strong correlation. In the fields of condensed matter, nuclear structure and molecular electronic structure, it has significantly extended the system sizes that can be handled compared to full configuration interaction, without losing numerical accuracy. For quantum chemistry (QC), the most efficient implementations of DMRG require the incorporation of particle number, spin and point group symmetries in the underlying matrix product state (MPS) ansatz, as well as the use of so-called complementary operators. The symmetries introduce a sparse block structure in the MPS ansatz and in the intermediary contracted tensors. If a symmetry is non-abelian, the Wigner-Eckart theorem allows to factorize a tensor into a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient and a reduced tensor. In addition, the fermion signs have to be carefully tracked. Because of these challenges, implementing DMRG efficiently for QC is not straightforward. Efficient and freely available implementations are therefore highly desired. In this work we present CheMPS2, our free open-source spin-adapted implementation of DMRG for ab initio QC. Around CheMPS2, we have implemented the augmented Hessian Newton-Raphson complete active space self-consistent field method, with exact Hessian. The bond dissociation curves of the 12 lowest states of the carbon dimer were obtained at the DMRG(28 orbitals, 12 electrons, D SU(2)=2500)/cc-pVDZ level of theory. The contribution of 1s core correlation to the X1??g+ bond dissociation curve of the carbon dimer was estimated by comparing energies at the DMRG(36o, 12e, D SU(2)=2500)/cc-pCVDZ and DMRG-SCF(34o, 8e, DSU(2)=2500)/ cc-pCVDZ levels of theory.

External routines: Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS), Linear Algebra Package (LAPACK), GNU Scientific Library (GSL), and Hierarchical Data Format Release 5 (HDF5) Nature of problem: The many-body Hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of single-particle states. Exact diagonalization solvers can therefore only handle small systems, of up to 18 electrons in 18 orbitals. Interesting active spaces are often significantly larger. Solution method: The density matrix renormalization group allows the extension of the size of active spaces, for which numerically exact solutions can be found, to about 40 electrons in 40 orbitals. In addition, it provides a rigorous variational upper bound to energies, as it has an underlying wavefunction ansatz, the matrix product state. Restrictions: Our implementation of the density matrix renormalization group is spin-adapted. This means that targeted eigenstates in the active space are exact eigenstates of the total electronic spin operator. Hamiltonians which break this symmetry (a magnetic field term for example) cannot be handled by our code. As electron repulsion integrals in Gaussian basis sets have eightfold permutation symmetry, we have used this property in our code. Unusual features: The nature of the matrix product state ansatz allows for exact spin coupling. In CheMPS2, the total electronic spin is imposed (not just the spin projection), in addition to the particle-number and abelian point-group symmetries. Running time: The running time depends on the size of the targeted active space, the number of desired eigenstates, their symmetry, the density of states, the individual orbital symmetries, the orbital ordering, the desired level of convergence, and the chosen convergence scheme. To converge a single point of one of the dissociation curves of the carbon dimer (D???h??? D2h symmetry) in the cc-pVDZ basis (28 orbitals; their ordering is described in Section 5.3) with 2500 reduced renormalized basis states (see the convergence scheme in Section 5.4; the variational energy then lies 0.1m Eh above the fully converged result) takes about 8 h on a single node with a dual-socket octa-core Intel Xeon Sandy Bridge (E5-2670) (16 cores at 2.6 GHz), and requires 6 GB of RAM. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These wavefunctions, which go by such names as matrix product states and tensor network states, occupy a different region of Hilbert space from wavefunctions built around the Hartree–Fock limit. The best known class of low entanglement wavefunctions, the matrix product states, forms the variational space of the density matrix renormalization group algo- rithm. Because of their different structure to many other quantum chemistry wavefunctions, low entanglement approximations hold promise for problems conventionally considered hard in quantum chemistry, and in particular prob- lems which have a multireference or strong correlation nature. In this review, we describe low entanglement wavefunctions at an introductory level, focus- ing on the main theoretical ideas. Topics covered include the theory of effi- cient wavefunction approximations, entanglement, matrix product states, and tensor network states including the tree tensor network, projected entangled pair states, and themultiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz.},

These methods are standard tools for the investigation of a variety of interacting quantum systems, especially low-dimensional quantum lattice models. We also survey extensions to the methods to calculate properties such as dynamical quantities and behavior at finite temperature, and discuss generalizations of the DMRG method to a wider variety of systems, such as classical models and quantum chemical problems. Finally, we briefly review some recent developments for obtaining a more general formulation of the DMRG in the context of matrix product states as well as recent progress in calculating the time evolution of quantum systems using the DMRG and the relationship of the foundations of the method with quantum information theory.},

abstract = {We describe a formulation of multi-reference perturbation theory that obtains a rigorous upper bound to the second order energy by minimizing the Hylleraas functional in the space of matrix product states (MPS). The first order wavefunctions so obtained can also be used to compute the third order energy with little overhead. Our formulation has several advantages including (i) flexibility with respect to the choice of zeroth order Hamiltonian, (ii) recovery of the exact uncontracted multi-reference perturbation theory energies in the limit of large MPS bond dimension, (iii) no requirement to compute high body density matrices, (iv) an embarrassingly parallel algorithm (scaling up to the number of virtual orbitals, squared, processors). Preliminary numerical examples show that the MPS bond dimension required for accurate first order wavefunctions scales sub-linearly with the size of the basis.},

abstract = {Semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes are classified into two types by means of orbital angular momentum of valley state, which is useful to study their low energy electronic properties in finite-length. The classification is given by an integer $d$, which is the greatest common divisor of two integers $n$ and $m$ specifying the chirality of nanotubes, by analyzing cutting lines. For the case that $d$ is equal to or greater than four, two lowest subbands from two valleys have different angular momenta with respect to the nanotube axis. Reflecting the decoupling of two valleys, discrete energy levels in finite-length nanotubes exhibit nearly fourfold degeneracy and its small lift by the spin-orbit interaction. For the case that $d$ is less than or equal to two, in which two lowest subbands from two valleys have the same angular momentum, discrete levels exhibit lift of fourfold degeneracy reflecting the coupling of two valleys. Especially, two valleys are strongly coupled when the chirality is close to the armchair chirality. An effective one-dimensional lattice model is derived by extracting states with relevant angular momentum, which reveals the valley coupling in the eigenstates. A bulk-edge correspondence, relationship between number of edge states and the winding number calculated in the corresponding bulk system, is analytically shown by using the argument principle, which enables us to estimate the number of edge states from the bulk property. The number of edge states depends not only on the chirality but also on the shape of boundary.},

While this is very close to the melting point of bulk beta-Ga (-16 degrees C), it is considerably higher than that of bulk gamma-Ga (-35.6 degrees C).

abstract = {The structural, electronic, dielectric, and elastic properties of zigzag and armchair single-walled carbon nanotubes are investigated at different DFT levels (LDA, GGA, hybrids) with Gaussian type basis sets of increasing size (from 3-21G to 6-1111G(2d,f)). The longitudinal and transverse polarizabilities are evaluated by using the Coupled Perturbed Hartree?Fock and Kohn?Sham computational schemes, which take into account the orbital relaxation through a self-consistent scheme. It is shown that the difference between the frequently adopted SOS (sum over states, uncoupled) and the fully coupled results is far from being negligible and varies as a function of the tensor component and the adopted functional. Helical symmetry is fully exploited. This allows simulation of tubes larger (up to 140 atoms in the unit cell) than in previous studies by using extended basis sets and severe computational conditions. All the 12 functionals considered here provide similar results for the structural and the elastic properties and for the relative stability among nanotubes and with respect to graphene. On the contrary, the stability with respect to diamond, which has a quite different density than that of nanotubes, sensitively depends on the adopted functional. The band gap and the longitudinal polarizability are strongly dependent on the level of approximation: hybrid functionals provide the least deviation from experimental data. In general, data obtained for (n, n), (3n, 0), (3n + 1, 0), and (3n + 2, 0) rolling directions approach the slab limit for large radii following four distinct trends.},

abstract = {We report here the results for an ab initio approach to obtain the parameters needed for molecular simulations using a polarizable force field. These parameters consist of the atomic charges, polarizabilities, and radii. The former two are readily obtained using methods reported previously (van Duijnen and Swart, J Phys Chem A 1998, 102, 2399; Swart et al. J Comput Chem 2001, 22, 79), whereas here we report a new approach for obtaining atomic second-order radii (SOR), which is based on second-order atomic moments in scaled Voronoi cells. These parameters are obtained from quantum- chemistry calculations on the monomers, and used without further adaptation directly for intermolecular interactions. The approach works very well as shown here for four dimers, where high-level coupled cluster with singles and doubles, and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) and density functional theory (DFT) Swart-Sola `-Bickelhaupt functional including Grimme's dispersion correction (SSB-D) reference data are available for comparison. The energy surfaces for the three methods are very similar, which is also the case for the interaction between a water molecule with either a chloride anion or a sodium cation. These latter systems had previously been used to criticize Thole's damped point-dipole method, but here we show that with the correct use of the method, it is perfectly able to describe the intermolecular interactions. This is most obvious for the induced dipole moment as function of the chloride–oxygen distance, where the direct (discrete) reaction field results are virtually indistinguishable from those obtained at CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ.},

For the smallest chains (i.e., Be(2) and Be(3)), smaller basis sets give dissociative energy profiles, so large basis set is demanded for the reproduction of equilibrium minima in the structures. For Be(4) and Be(5) linear chains, the energy profiles show a minimum also by using the smallest basis sets, but the largest ones give a much stronger stabilization energy. For all the structures, two spin states have been studied: the singlet and the triplet. It is shown that the energy separation of the two states, in the equilibrium region, is small and decays exponentially with respect to the number of atoms in the chain. Finally an interpolative technique allowing for the estimation of the long-chain parameters from shorter ones is presented.},

To meet the challenge, we study these properties using our newly developed thermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory (TAO-DFT), a very efficient method for the study of large systems with strong static correlation effects. Besides, to examine the role of cyclic topology, the electronic properties of cyclacenes are also compared with those of acenes. Similar to acenes, the ground states of cyclacenes are singlets for all the cases studied. In contrast to acenes, the electronic properties of cyclacenes, however, exhibit oscillatory behavior (for n <= 30) in the approach to the corresponding properties of acenes with increasing number of benzene rings. On the basis of the calculated orbitals and their occupation numbers, the larger cyclacenes are shown to exhibit increasing polyradical character in their ground states, with the active orbitals being mainly localized at the peripheral carbon atoms.},

Because homoleptic polynitrogen compounds with more than three nitrogen atoms are nearly unknown and generally not very stable, we investigated possible products of this addition reaction. We also computed transition states for various interconversions and dissociative reactions to assess the stability of the addition products. Seven structures are minima at the B3LYP/aug-cc-PVDZ and MBPT(2)/aug-cc-pVDZ levels of theory: Five diazidyldiazenes and two diazidylaminonitrenes or N-3-N-5 complexes. Gibbs free energies based on CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ single-point calculations strongly suggest that only four of the diazidyldiazene structures are minima at higher levels of theory. We show that CCSD(T) produces good energies for molecules with some multireference character using DIP-STEOM-CCSD. In diazidyldiazenes, the loss of N-2 from one of the azidyl end groups is as likely as the loss of both azidyl groups. Isolation of covalently bonded Ns from N-5(+) and N-3- will be difficult because the most likely product has a decomposition barrier of only 18 kcal/mol. It may not be formed at all, because one of the approach pathways has great potential for mutual neutralization and subsequent fragmentation},

abstract = {Since their discovery in 1991, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted significant attention because of their remarkable mechanical, electronic, and optical properties. Structural uniformity of the CNT is critically important because the sidewall structures (armchair, zigzag, and chiral) determine many of the significant properties of CNTs. Ideally researchers would synthesize CNTs with a defined target sidewall structure and diameter, but the current synthetic methods, such as arc discharge and chemical vapor deposition, only provide CNTs as the mixtures of various structures. Purification of these mixtures does not allow researchers to isolate a structurally uniform CNT, which is the bottleneck for fundamental studies and advanced applications of these materials. Therefore, the selective and predictable synthesis of structurally uniform CNTs would represent a critical advance in both nanocarbon science and synthetic chemistry. This Account highlights our efforts toward the bottom-up synthesis of structurally uniform carbon nanotubes (CNTs). We envisioned a bottom-up synthesis of structurally uniform CNTs through a controlled growth process from a short carbon nanoring (template) that corresponds to the target structure of CNTs. Our simple retrosynthetic analysis led to the identification of cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs), acene-inserted CPPs, and cyclacenes as the shortest sidewall segments of armchair, chiral, and zigzag CNTs, respectively. With this overall picture in mind, we initiated our synthetic studies of aromatic rings/belts as an initial step toward structurally uniform CNTs in 2005. This research has led to (i) a general strategy for the synthesis of CPPs and related carbon nanorings using cyclohexane derivatives as a benzene-convertible L-shaped unit, (ii) a modular, size-selective, and scalable synthesis of [n]CPPs (a shortest segment of armchair CNTs), (iii) the X-ray crystal structure analysis of CPPs, (iv) the design and synthesis of acene-inserted CPPs as the shortest segment of chiral CNTs, and (v) the first synthesis of cyclo-1,4-naphthylene, a pi-extended CPP. We believe this work will serve as important initial steps toward a controlled synthesis of CNTs.},

abstract = {The development of M{\o}ller–Plesset perturbation theory (MPPT) has seen four different periods in almost 80 years. In the first 40 years (period 1), MPPT was largely ignored because the focus of quantum chemists was on variational methods. After the development of many-body perturbation theory by theoretical physicists in the 1950s and 1960s, a second 20-year long period started, during which MPn methods up to order n = 6 were developed and computer-programed. In the late 1980s and in the 1990s (period 3), shortcomings of MPPT became obvious, especially the sometimes erratic or even divergent behavior of the MPn series. The physical usefulness of MPPT was questioned and it was suggested to abandon the theory. Since the 1990s (period 4), the focus of method development work has been almost exclusively on MP2. A wealth of techniques and approaches has been put forward to convert MP2 from a O(M5) computational problem into a low-order or linear-scaling task that can handle molecules with thousands of atoms. In addition, the accuracy of MP2 has been systematically improved by introducing spin scaling, dispersion corrections, orbital optimization, or explicit correlation. The coming years will see a continuously strong development in MPPT that will have an essential impact on other quantum chemical methods.},

Using simple INDO-SCF-MO wave functions, we give applications of the natural hybrid orbital analysis to molecules exhibiting a variety of bonding features, including lone pairs, multiple bonds, strained rings, and “bent bonds”, multiple resonance structures, hydrogen bonds, and three-center bonds. Three examples are described in greater detail: (i) “orbital following” during ammonia umbrella inversion, (ii) the dimerization of water molecules, and (iii) the hydrogen-bridged bonds of diborane.},

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed a closed-shell ground state for [12]BC, whereas an open-shell ground state was suggested for [12]cyclacene. The calculated strain energy and frontier molecular orbital energies of [12]BC also implied high stability. An unstrained macrocycle 1, consisting of orthophenylene and ethynylene moieties, was designed as a potential precursor for [12]BC and synthesized by sequential Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling of diphenylacetylene derivatives. While the conversion of 1 into [12]BC is still under investigation, an unexpected rearrangement of the triene moieties in 1, affording a tribenzo[f,k,m]tetraphene structure, was discovered during the screening of reaction conditions. An attempt was made to rationalize this result by proposing a plausible reaction mechanism that proceeds via intermediates containing cyclobutadiene or Dewar benzene moieties.

Using the tight-binding method, we proceed in parallel to determine the band structure of these tubes. The effect of cluster size on the structure of frontier orbitals and on the cluster stability is investigated for the (6,0) tube. We show that the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of the (n,0) tube fragments are localized on the edge atoms. The comparison between the band structure of the (6,0) tube and the molecular orbitals of the (6,0) tube fragment with 13 carbon hexagons along the tube axis indicates that the spatial structure of the HOMO`s and the LUMO`s directly corresponds to that of the Bloch wave functions of occupied and unoccupied pi bands near the Fermi level.},

abstract = {The curvature dependence of the physisorption properties of a water molecule inside and outside an armchair carbon nanotube (CNT) is investigated by an incremental density-fitting local coupled cluster treatment with single and double excitations and perturbative triples (DF-LCCSD(T)) study. Our results show that a water molecule outside and inside (n, n) CNTs (n = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10) is stabilized by electron correlation. The adsorption energy of water inside CNTs decreases quickly with the decrease of curvature (increase of radius) and the configuration with the oxygen pointing toward the CNT wall is the most stable one. However, when the water molecule is adsorbed outside the CNT, the adsorption energy varies only slightly with the curvature and the configuration with hydrogens pointing toward the CNT wall is the most stable one. We also use the DF-LCCSD(T) results to parameterize Lennard-Jones (LJ) force fields for the interaction of water both with the inner and outer sides of CNTs and with graphene representing the zero curvature limit. It is not possible to reproduce all DF-LCCSD(T) results for water inside and outside CNTs of different curvature by a single set of LJ parameters, but two sets have to be used instead. Each of the two resulting sets can reproduce three out of four minima of the effective potential curves reasonably well. These LJ models are then used to calculate the water adsorption energies of larger CNTs, approaching the graphene limit, thus bridging the gap between CNTs of increasing radius and flat graphene sheets. {\textcopyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Internally contracted CASPT2 requires to contract the generalized Fock matrix with the 4-particle reduced density matrix (4-RDM) of the reference wavefunction. The required 4-RDM elements can be obtained from 3-particle reduced density matrices (3-RDM) of different wavefunctions, formed by symmetry-conserving single-particle excitations op top of the reference wavefunction. In our spin-adapted DMRG code chemps2 [https://github.com/sebwouters/chemps2], we decompose these excited wavefunctions as spin-adapted matrix product states, and calculate their 3-RDM in order to obtain the required contraction of the generalized Fock matrix with the 4-RDM of the reference wavefunction.

The DF-SCS-LMP2 dissociation energies for the three structures are also compared with new complete basis set estimates of the interaction energies obtained from accurate coupled cluster (CCSD(T)) and DF-SCS-MP2 calculations.

B, 89, 201106(R), 2014] whose performance is assessed against electronic structures obtained form DMRG reference data. Our numerical analysis covers model systems for strong correlation: the one-dimensional Hubbard model with periodic boundary condition as well as metallic and molecular hydrogen rings. Specifically, the accuracy of AP1roG is benchmarked using the single-orbital entropy, the orbital-pair mutual information as well as the eigenvalue spectrum of the one-orbital and two-orbital reduced density matrices. Our study indicates that contributions from singly occupied states become important in the strong correlation regime which highlights the limitations of the AP1roG method. Furthermore, we examine the effect of orbital rotations within the AP1roG model on correlations between orbital pairs.},

We perform both Hartree-Fock (HF) and unrestricted density functional theory calculations for the borazine and benzene cyclacenes system to obtain insights into the structural and electronic properties as a function of the number of rings present in cyclacene. The properties of the borazine cyclacene show little dependence on the number of rings ( R ∼4-12) in the peripheral circuits, in contrast to the benzene cyclacene system. The frontier HOMO-LUMO gap in borazine cyclacene increases steadily with R and stabilizes at ∼6.7 eV for R>9, in contrast to the benzene cyclacene system where the gap decreases and approaches that of the semiconducting carbon nanotube system (∼1.13 eV) for R>8. The aromaticity of the rings is investigated by examining the energy separations in the frontier molecular orbitals. Vibrational modes in the borazine cyclacene systems were also calculated using HF method (HF/3-21G) and compared with experimental Raman measurements on hexagonal BN materials. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {It has recently been recognised that the strong spin-orbit interaction present in solids can lead to new phenomena, such as materials with non-trivial topological order. Although the atomic spin-orbit coupling in carbon is weak, the spin-orbit coupling in carbon nanotubes can be significant due to their curved surface. Previous works have reported spin-orbit couplings in reasonable agreement with theory, and this coupling strength has formed the basis of a large number of theoretical proposals. Here we report a spin-orbit coupling in three carbon nanotube devices that is an order of magnitude larger than previously measured. We find a zero-field spin splitting of up to 3.4 meV, corresponding to a built-in effective magnetic field of 29 T aligned along the nanotube axis. Although the origin of the large spin-orbit coupling is not explained by existing theories, its strength is promising for applications of the spin-orbit interaction in carbon nanotubes devices.},

abstract = {The Hellmann–Feynman theorem assures us that the forces felt by the nuclei in a molecule or complex are purely classically electrostatic. Nevertheless, it is often claimed (incorrectly) that electrostatic considerations are not sufficient to explain noncovalent interactions. Such assertions arise largely from neglecting the polarization that is inherently part of the electrostatic interaction, and must be taken into account. Accordingly, we now outline the requirements for a correct electrostatic treatment and discuss the difference between physical observables and quantities that arise from mathematical models. Polarization and donor–acceptor charge transfer are shown to be equivalent for weak interactions. However, polarization is a physical observable while charge transfer, in this context, is mathematical modelling. We also discuss some popular schemes for analyzing noncovalent interactions.},

This work surveys and extends recent research which demonstrates that randomization offers a powerful tool for performing low-rank matrix approximation. These techniques exploit modern computational architectures more fully than classical methods and open the possibility of dealing with truly massive data sets. This paper presents a modular framework for constructing randomized algorithms that compute partial matrix decompositions. These methods use random sampling to identify a subspace that captures most of the action of a matrix. The input matrix is then compressed---either explicitly or implicitly---to this subspace, and the reduced matrix is manipulated deterministically to obtain the desired low-rank factorization. In many cases, this approach beats its classical competitors in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness. These claims are supported by extensive numerical experiments and a detailed error analysis.},

The inverse approach to deduce a structure for a prede- fined property would be highly desirable, but is, unfortunately, not well defined. However, feasible strategies for such an inverse design process may be successfully developed for specific pur- poses. We discuss options for calculating “jacket” potentials that fulfill a predefined target requirement—a concept that we recently introduced (Weymuth and Reiher, MRS Proceedings 2013, 1524, DOI:10.1557/opl.2012.1764). We consider the case of small-molecule activating transition metal catalysts. As a target requirement we choose the vanishing geometry gradients on all atoms of a subsystem consisting of a metal center binding the small molecule to be activated. The jacket potential can be rep- resented within a full quantum model or by a sequence of approximations of which a field of electrostatic point charges is the simplest. In a second step, the jacket potential needs to be replaced by a chemically viable chelate-ligand structure for which the geometry gradients on all of its atoms are also required to vanish. To analyze the feasibility of this approach, we dissect a known dinitrogen-fixating catalyst to study possible design strategies that must eventually produce the known cata- lyst.},

Fragment embedding is an attractive approach to this problem. By dividing a large complicated system into smaller manageable fragments “embedded” in an approximate description of the rest of the system, we can hope to ameliorate the steep cost of correlated calculations. While appealing, these methods often converge slowly with fragment size because of small errors at the boundary between fragment and bath. We describe a new electronic embedding method, dubbed “Bootstrap Embedding,” a self-consistent wavefunction-in-wavefunction embedding theory that uses overlapping fragments to improve the description of fragment edges. We apply this method to the one dimensional Hubbard model and a translationally asymmetric variant, and find that it performs very well for energies and populations. We find Bootstrap Embedding converges rapidly with embedded fragment size, overcoming the surface-area-to-volume-ratio error typical of many embedding methods. We anticipate that this method may lead to a low-scaling, high accuracy treatment of electron correlation in large molecular systems.},

On the basis of configurations and orbital occupation numbers obtained for the CASSCF wavefunction and of the orbital entropy measurements evaluated for the DMRG wavefunction, we unravel electron-correlation effects in the Ru coordination sphere of the complex. It is shown that Ru–NO pi bonds show static and dynamic correlation, while other Ru–ligand bonds feature predominantly dynamic correlation. The presence of static correlation requires the use of multiconfigurational methods to describe the Ru–NO bond. Subsequently, the CASSCF wavefunction is analysed in terms of configuration state functions based on localised orbitals. The analysis of the wavefunctions in the electronic singlet ground state and the first triplet state provides a picture of the Ru–NO moiety beyond the standard representation based on formal oxidation states. A distinct description of the Ru and NO fragments is advocated. The electron configuration of Ru is an equally weighted superposition of RuII and RuIII configurations, with the RuIII configuration originating from charge donation mostly from Cl ligands. However, and contrary to what is typically assumed, the electronic configuration of the NO ligand is best described as electroneutral.},

The method reproduces the solution of the complete active space with second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2) when the DMRG reference function is represented by a sufficiently large number of renormalized many-body basis, thereby being named DMRG-CASPT2 method. The DMRG-SCF is able to describe non-dynamical correlation with large active space that is insurmountable to the conventional CASSCF method, while the second-order perturbation theory provides an efficient description of dynamical correlation effects. The capability of our implementation is demonstrated for an application to the potential energy curve of the chromium dimer, which is one of the most demanding multireference systems that require best electronic structure treatment for non-dynamical and dynamical correlation as well as large basis sets. The DMRG-CASPT2/cc-pwCV5Z calculations were performed with a large (3d double-shell) active space consisting of 28 orbitals. Our approach using large-size DMRG reference addressed the problems of why the dissociation energy is largely overestimated by CASPT2 with the small active space consisting of 12 orbitals (3d4s), and also is oversensitive to the choice of the zeroth-order Hamiltonian.},

abstract = {Hydrogen storage in carbonaceous materials and their derivatives is currently a widely investigated topic. The rational design of novel adsorptive materials is often attempted with the help of computational chemistry tools, in particular density functional theory (DFT). However, different exchange–correlation functionals provide a very wide range of hydrogen binding energies. The aim of this article is to offer high level QM reference data based on coupled-cluster singles and doubles calculations with perturbative triple excitations, CCSD(T), and a complete basis set limit estimate that can be used to assess the accuracy of various DFT-based predictions. For one complex, the CCSD(T) result is verified against diffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Reference binding curves are calculated for two model compounds representing weak and strong hydrogen adsorption: coronene (−4.7 kJ mol−1 per H2), and coronene modified with boron and lithium (−14.3 kJ mol−1). The reference data are compared to results obtained with widely used density functionals including pure DFT, M06, DFT-D3, PBE-TS, PBE + MBD, optB88-vdW, vdW-DF, vdW-DF2 and VV10. We find that whereas DFT-D3 shows excellent results for weak hydrogen adsorption on coronene, most of the less empirical density based dispersion functionals except VV10 overestimate this interaction. On the other hand, some of the less empirical density based dispersion functionals better describe stronger binding in the more polar coroB2Li22H2 complex which is one of realistic models for high-capacity hydrogen storage materials. Our results may serve as a guide for choosing suitable DFT methods for quickly evaluating hydrogen binding potential and as a reference for assessing the accuracy of the previously published DFT results.},

abstract = {This survey provides an overview of higher-order tensor decompositions, their applications, and available software. A tensor is a multidimensional or N-way array. Decompositions of higher-order tensors (i.e., N-way arrays with N ≥ 3) have applications in psychometrics, chemometrics, signal processing, numerical linear algebra, computer vision, numerical analysis, data mining, neuroscience, graph analysis, and elsewhere. Two particular tensor decompositions can be considered to be higher-order extensions of the matrix singular value decomposition:CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposes a tensor as a sum of rank-one tensors, and the Tucker decomposition is a higher-order form of principal component analysis. There are many other tensor decompositions, including INDSCAL, PARAFAC2, CANDELINC, DEDICOM, and PARATUCK2 as well as nonnegative variants of all of the above. The N-way Toolbox, Tensor Toolbox, and Multilinear Engine are examples of software packages for working with tensors.},

abstract = {Renormalization is a powerful concept in the many-body problem. Inspired by the highly successful density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm, and the quantum chemical graphical representation of configuration space, we introduce a new theoretical tool: Hilbert space renormalization, to describe many-electron correlations. While in DMRG, the many-body states in nested Fock subspaces are successively renormalized, in Hilbert space renormalization, many-body states in nested Hilbert subspaces undergo renormalization. This provides a new way to classify and combine configurations. The underlying wavefunction ansatz, namely the Hilbert space matrix product state (HS-MPS), has a very rich and flexible mathematical structure. It provides low-rank tensor approximations to any configuration interaction (CI) space through restricting either the 'physical indices' or the coupling rules in the HS-MPS. Alternatively, simply truncating the 'virtual dimension' of the HS-MPS leads to a family of size-extensive wave function ansaetze that can be used efficiently in variational calculations. We make formal and numerical comparisons between the HS-MPS, the traditional Fock-space MPS used in DMRG, and traditional CI approximations. The analysis and results shed light on fundamental aspects of the efficient representation of many-electron wavefunctions through the renormalization of many-body states.},

abstract = {The formal and computational attraction of effective one-particle theories like Hartree-Fock and density functional theory raise the question of how far such approaches can be taken to offer exact results for selected properties of electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids. Some properties can be exactly described within an effective one-particle theory, like principal ionization potentials and electron affinities. This fact can be used to develop equations for a correlated orbital theory (COT) that guarantees a correct one-particle energy spectrum. They are built upon a coupled-cluster based frequency independent self-energy operator presented here, which distinguishes the approach from Dyson theory. The COT also offers an alternative to Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT), whose objective is to represent the electronic density exactly as a single determinant, while paying less attention to the energy spectrum. For any estimate of two-electron terms COT offers a litmus test of its accuracy for principal Ip's and Ea's. This feature for approximating the COT equations is illustrated numerically. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Capillarity in open tubes has already been demonstrated2–5, while predictions regarding their electronic structure6–8 and mechanical strength9 remain to be tested. To examine the properties of these structures, one needs tubes with well defined morphologies, length, thickness and a number of concentric shells; but the normal carbon-arc synthesis10,11 yields a range of tube types. In particular, most calculations have been concerned with single-shell tubes, whereas the carbon-arc synthesis produces almost entirely multi-shell tubes. Here we report the synthesis of abundant single-shell tubes with diameters of about one nanometre. Whereas the multi-shell nanotubes are formed on the carbon cathode, these single-shell tubes grow in the gas phase. Electron diffraction from a single tube allows us to confirm the helical arrangement of carbon hexagons deduced previously for multi-shell tubes1.},
